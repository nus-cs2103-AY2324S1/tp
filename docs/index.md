**SOCareers is your ultimate companion to managing your professional connections and internship applications.**
Designed with School of Computing (SoC) students in mind, it is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, SOCareers enables you to organise your information more efficiently than traditional Graphical
User Interface (GUI) apps.

* If you are interested in using SOCareers, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing SOCareers, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
