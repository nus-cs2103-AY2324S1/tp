ClubMembersContacts is an app to help EXCO members of School of Computing's CCAs to manage the contacts of all their members and applicants in a fast and convenient yet powerful way through a CLI or text-based interface for greater speed.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* If you are interested in using ClubMembersContacts, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing ClubMembersContacts, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
