## About CodeSphere
CodeSphere is a desktop contact management app, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is an app targeted at Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing (SoC) to help them better manage administration of their students.
