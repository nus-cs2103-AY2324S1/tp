**Advanced&Efficient (A&E)** is a desktop application that helps Emergency Department (ED) doctors in managing
patient records and connecting patients to relevant departments. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using A&E, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing A&E, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
