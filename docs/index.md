iVolunteer is your dedicated application for volunteer coordination, designed with **volunteer coordinators** in mind. It combines the efficiency of a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the advantages of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you're looking to enhance your volunteer coordination tasks, iVolunteer is the tool that empowers you to **get things done efficiently**. Whether you're creating events, updating details, or managing volunteers, iVolunteer streamlines the process for **swift and effective coordination**.

While iVolunteer uses a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using iVolunteer, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing iVolunteer, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
