**HomeBoss is a desktop application for home businesses who need to manage their deliveries for their customers.** 
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using HomeBoss,
  head over to the [_Getting Started_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#getting-started).
* If you are interested about developing HomeBoss,
  the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
