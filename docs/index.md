**TAvigator** streamlines the teaching process for Teaching Assistants (TAs) teaching Computer Science courses in the National University of Singapore. Our software understands the various roles a TA has to play, from meticulous record-keeping to fostering connections with students.

TAvigator is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAvigator can get your lesson management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using TAvigator, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TAvigator, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
