**MediFlowR is a desktop app for managing patient records and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using MediFlowR, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
