**CoordiMate** is a **desktop app for event planners**. It helps you **manage your contacts and tasks** for your events, so that you can focus on the event itself.

While it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), most of the user interactions happen using a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, allowing you to get your contact management tasks done **faster than traditional GUI apps**.

### Getting Started

* If you are interested in using CoordiMate, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing CoordiMate, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
