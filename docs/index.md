EduTrack is a **powerful desktop app designed for SOC tutors**, allowing you to streamline your teaching tasks and effortlessly track your student records.

Whether you find yourself juggling the management of numerous students or simply require swift access to individual student information, EduTrack equips you with the tools to easily organize your classes.

The application is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
