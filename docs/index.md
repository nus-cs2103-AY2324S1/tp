HR Insight is a **desktop app for HR people, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The _purpose_ of this app is to provide **HR employees** a _centralized employee management system_ to better manage all employees' details and **improve the
efficiency** of their workflow.
