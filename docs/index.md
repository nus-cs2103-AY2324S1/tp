_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

With _LetsGetHired_, you can benefit from:
- **Swift Viewing**: Swiftly view your internship applications and monitor their status.
- **Status Updates**: Stay updated on the progress of each application, from application sent to interview stages.
- **Organization**: Organize your internship applications according to your needs for better clarity.
- **Notes**: Add personalized notes to each internship application, ensuring you never forget key details.
- **Deadlines**: Set and track deadlines for your internship applications, so you never miss an opportunity.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**
