**CheckMate is a desktop application for streamlining the process of booking rooms by hotel employees.** 
With a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the necessary information needed at a glance, and the application
being optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), we have combined elegance and efficiency when it comes to 
the process of room booking by hotel receptionists.

* If you are interested in using CheckMate, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about making extensions to CheckMate, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
