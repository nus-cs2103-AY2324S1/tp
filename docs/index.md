**WedLog is a desktop application created for partners getting married that helps them manage the guests and vendors involved in the wedding.**
While it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), most of the user interactions occur through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

* If you are interested in using WedLog, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing WedLog, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
