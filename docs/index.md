ToothTracker is an **All-in-One solution for Effortless Dental Clinic Record Management.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using ToothTracker, head over to the [**Get Started with ToothTracker**](UserGuide.html#get-started-with-toothtracker).
* If you are interested about developing ToothTracker, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
