* Connectify is a **desktop app for managing connections, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using Connectify, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Connectify, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
