**RealtorTrackerPlusMax (RTPM) is an app that allows tech-savvy realtors in their 20s to keep track of their many clients and houses
all in one place. This product has an edge over conventional tracking methods like Google Sheets as it provides a
cleaner UI, is easier and quicker to organise via keyboard-typed commands, and has proposed features such as
auto-matching of clients and houses.**

* If you are interested in using RTPM, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing RTPM, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
