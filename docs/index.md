## Introducing our product - ProfBook
ProfBook is a dedicated desktop application tailored for CS2103T tutors, enabling efficient task management and student oversight within a single tutorial slot. It simplifies the handling of tasks and provides a comprehensive student management system, offering a personalized touch through student profiles for easy recognition during lessons.

* It is **written in OOP fashion** and comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `ProfBook` because it aims to help professors to keep track of the many tutorial groups as well as the
  many deadlines and submission.
