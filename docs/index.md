**TAManager is a desktop application for professors from the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore
to manage details of their teaching assistants.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TAM, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TAM, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
