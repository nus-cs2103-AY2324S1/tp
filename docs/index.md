**ConText** is a desktop app that allows for managing contacts quickly via text commands, with useful features relevant to NUS SoC students.
While it has a Graphical User Interface, most of its user interactions happen via an in-app Command Line Interface.

- If you are interested in using ConText, please check out the [**User Guide**](./UserGuide.html).
- If you are interested about developing ConText, the [**Developer Guide**](./DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
