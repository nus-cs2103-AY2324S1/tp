**InsureIQ is a desktop application for car insurance agents who type fast over CLI and have to keep track of multiple customers' vehicles with the car insurance policies.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using InsureIQ, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing InsureIQ, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
