***Taking care of your finances has never been easier!***

Spend N Split (SNS) is an application for managing transactions from your contacts list. Built for university students
that reside on campus, it utilises your fast typing skills to help you maintain financial accountability between
yourself and your peers. All you need to do, is to record your transactions in Spend N Split. Filtering, sorting, as
well as the calculations of balances owed will be automatically handled by Spend N Split.

* Main features:
  * Manage contacts and their personal information
  * Manage expenses between you and your contacts
* If you are interested in using SNS, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing SNS, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
