> UniCa$h is a finance tracking application for university students who want to be more financially conscious.

## About

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

User Target Profile: Our application is for university students who want to be more financially conscious about their
spending habits, enabling them to make wiser economic decisions, providing students on a limited budget with more
purchasing power.

Value Proposition: It provides university students with an intuitive and frictionless experience to have transparency on
their expenditure to help them better understand their expenditure so they can develop better financial habits as they
transition into adulthood.
