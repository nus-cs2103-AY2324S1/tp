**FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to keep track of large numbers of contacts**. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

## Problem Addressed
* Financial advisors often deal with a significant number of clients and contacts. Keeping track of client details and 
  categorising contacts can become challenging without an efficient system.
* Financial advisors need tools that help streamline their workflow, enabling them to provide effective financial
  services. Current tools are too slow and use the mouse too much (much slower than typing)
* Financial advisors use too many tools concurrently and as such, this impacts their workflow and introduces confusion.
  FAPro integrates these tools (Contact storage, calendar and risk assessment questionnaire) into one program.
* Financial advisors may face challenges in adopting and adapting to advanced technologies. FAPro is easy to use and 
  very well documented with images throughout its user guide to guide users along.
