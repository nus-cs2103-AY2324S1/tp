**Foster Family is a desktop application for managing animal foster families.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Foster Family, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Foster Family, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
