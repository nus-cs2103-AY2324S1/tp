JobFindr is a **Desktop-based Job Application Management App** for **NUS Fresh Graduates** to record, track and organise
their job applications.

JobFindr aims to simplify your job application management by targeting the following benefits:

1. _Flexibility_ in **adding**, **deleting** and **editing** job applications and interviews
2. _Efficiency_ in **finding** the specific application with minimal keywords
3. _Organisation_ in **sorting** the list of applications to not miss out on key opportunities

* If you are interested in using JobFindr, head over to the [**Quick Start**](UserGuide.html#quick-start) section of
  the **User Guide**.
* If you are interested about developing JobFindr, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
