# JABPro User Guide

## Product Overview

JobApplicationsBook Pro (JABPro) is a **desktop app for hiring managers of companies to ease the management of applicants, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JABPro can get your applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `jabpro.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your JabPro.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar jabpro.jar` command to run the application.<br>  
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: adds an applicant with the specified contact details

    * `remark 1 r/Great attitude, hardworking`: edits the remark of the 1st person on the list to have a remark `Great attitude, hardworking`

    * `search n/John`: Searches for applicants whose names contain the keyword `John`

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `set` : sets the applicant status to either of: (Preliminary, Interviewed, Rejected, Offered)

    * `add linkedin 1 alexyeoh`: Adds LinkedIn account to candidate's existing contact information

    * `github Alex Yeoh`: Redirects the user to the Github account of the candidate

Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* When using parentheses ( ) with items separated by the slash symbol /, at least one item must be included. <br>
  e.g in the command `search (n/KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS] / st/KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS] / t/KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS])`, it is necessary to specify at least one search category.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
