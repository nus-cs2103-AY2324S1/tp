WellNUS is a *desktop application* used by **NUS Counsellors** to **manage and schedule appointments** with their student clients.

NUS counsellors have a hectic consultation schedule that constantly has to updated based on students' availability. This can lead to burnout due
to administrative task overload.

WellNUS eases this burden by providing a one-stop application for NUS counsellors to manage students' contact details and scheduling appointments.
It provides better visibility through neatly organized information, while preventing counsellors from making oversights like double booking a timeslot.

This user guide serves as a beginner-friendly (yet comprehensive!) walkthrough for all NUS counsellors on how to fully utilise the WellNUS application.
Our guide has three main components: 
1. Instructions on *downloading and setting up* the application
2. List of *available features*, and
3. Our *Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)*. Refer to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) below to navigate to your area of interest.

If you are interested in more technical details, please refer to our [Developer Guide](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: 
WellNUS is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, WellNUS can get your contact management and scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## 1. Getting started

###  1.1 Accessing the app

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. 
   1. To check the current version of Java installed on your system, refer to [this guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html).
   2. If Java is not installed or you have an outdated version, you may download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html).

2. Download the latest `wellnus.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).
   1. Click on the link above to be redirected to our *github repository*.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for WellNUS.
   1. Navigate to the folder `wellnus.jar` has been installed in. By default, it will be downloaded in the *Downloads* folder.
   2. Create a new folder on your Desktop (or any folder you want to put your application in) and move the `wellnus.jar` file into the folder.


4. Start up the WellNUS application.
   1. Open the *Command Prompt* (for Windows users) or *Terminal* (for Mac users). `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar wellnus.jar` command to run the application.
   2. Alternatively, if you moved it into a folder created on Desktop, you may run the following command:
      ```
      cd Desktop/{your_folder_name}
      java -jar wellnus.jar
      ```
      
   <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

   </div>

   A window similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME c/CONTACT_NUMBER`, `NAME` and `CONTACT_NUMBER` are parameters
  which can be used as `add n/John Doe c/98172645`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/RISK_LEVEL]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/low` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### 1.3 About student notes

Student notes of a student can be viewed by double-clicking on the specific student that you want under the "Student"
column. You can only view student notes for one student at a time. When you perform any commands, the notes column
will be cleared (You will have to double-click once again).

If you have any feedback on our features pertaining to student notes, feel free to send your feedback to the 
developer team!

### 2.5 Tracking TODOS `[Coming soon]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **How do I transfer my data to another Computer ?**<br/>
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous WellNUS home folder.

2. **How can I view my appointments scheduled today ?**<br/>
You can use the filter command with today's date. 
Here's an example: `filter 2023-12-07`. Replace `2023-12-07` with today's date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

3. **How do I clear all data in WellNUS ?**<br/>
To clear all data, use the `clear` command. This resets the storage, deleting all appointments and students. 
Exercise caution, as this action cannot be undone.

4. **How do I exit the WellNUS application ?**<br/>
To exit the program, use the `exit` command. This closes the application.

5. **I am unsure of a new student's risk level, what should I put ?**<br/>
If you're unsure of a new student's risk level, you can leave the risk level parameter blank when adding the student using the add command. 
WellNUS is designed to handle optional parameters. Here's an example:
`add n/John Doe c/98172645 a/821, Bishan, #02-124`
You can always update the risk level later using the tag command when more information becomes available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
