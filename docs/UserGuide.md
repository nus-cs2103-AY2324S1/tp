## Known Issues

- Newly added contacts/meetings are not automatically selected without scrolling down when there are several contacts/meetings already existing. However when adding a new contact the result box is updated for visual feedback.
- Some users reported that the scrollbar of the contact/meeting list disappears when the screen size is too small.
- Lists are sorted alphabetically instead of order they were added in. This is intended, and will likely be optimised in the future by adding a sort command (allowing the user to decide alphabetically or chronologically).
- The commands for contacts and meetings do not use the `id/` prefix, whereas the notes and adding of contacts to meetings commands do. We plan on standardising this in the future for user comfort.
