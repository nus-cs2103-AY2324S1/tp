# Introduction

InterviewHub (IH) is a **desktop app for engineering manager to schedule job interviews and manage applicants**.

It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

If you can type fast, IH can get your Interview management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Let's get started by following the [Quick Start](#Quick Start) section!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `InterviewHub.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for InterviewHub.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The Graphical User Interface(GUI) should appear in a few seconds.

5. To get a better understanding of what you see. Please refer to the [GUI Summary](#GUI Summary) for more details.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `nuke` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous InterviewHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
