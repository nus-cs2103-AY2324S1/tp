## **Introduction - What is TimetaBRO?**

Welcome to TimetaBRO, your ultimate companion for managing your university life, social interactions, and schedules. It is dedicated to NUS students who have many things on their plate and have trouble arranging meetings with friends and teammates.

In the past, NUS students had to tediously save their friend’s timetables, and compare them to their own. Most of the time, students do not even have the time to compare timetables and have to go through the hassle of coordination through messaging apps.

However, with TimetaBRO, you can now save your friends’ timetables, and ask it when your friends are free! Make scheduling meetups and meetings slick and easy, and while you’re busy scheduling the best dates, you can also save important details about your friends! No more forgetting birthdays or favourite foods, be the best friend you can be!

## **1. Quickstart**
Before we jump into it, let's make sure that your TimetaBRO is working properly!
1. Ensure you have Java 11 installed on your computer. This is important!
    * To check if Java 11 is currently installed, you may follow this [short guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-check-is-installed).
    * If Java 11 is not installed, you may follow the installation instructions over [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A).
2. Next, download the latest 'timetabro.jar' from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as a home folder for TimetaBRO.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. You should see a pop-up. That is your reminder for the events and birthdays for the day!

Here are some commands you can try:

  * `add n/Owen p/91792309 b/ 2001-12-26`:
  adds a friend named Owen, with phone number 91792309 and birthday on 26 December 2001.
  Say hello to your new friend!

  * `addschedule 1 type/module en/CS2101 h/Monday 1200 1400`:
  adds a module CS2101 into the schedule of the first person in your friends list that occurs on Monday 12pm to 2pm. If you did not change anything else, index 1 should refer to Alex Yeoh. He now has CS2101 in his timetable!

  * `cft Friday 1200 1400`:
  Filters your friend list to people who are free on these timings. Alex and Owen should both be free!

  * `delete 1`:
  Deletes a person off your list based on their index. It's time to say goodbye to Alex.

Nice! Now you know the basic commands and have launched TimetaBRO, lets get into the finer details.

## **3. Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be written by you!<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Commands are all case-sensitive! Please follow the format **exactly** as shown in this User Guide!

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order you like!<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, the order `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines! Space characters surrounding line-breaks may disappear when copied over to the application.

* Clicking on your friend's name will display their timetable on the bottom half of the right hand side of TimetaBRO.

* Only times in 30-minute intervals are allowed. <br>
  e.g. `1430` and `1500` will be excepted, `1445` and `2359` will not be valid! If your timings do not fit nicely into 30-minute chunks, try your best to round up/down, and use tags to remind yourself that it's actually at another time.<br> E.g. t/[insert Event Name] 1445

## **5. Saving the data**

TimetaBRO data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually!

## **6. Editing the data file**

TimetaBRO data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">Caution:
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TimetaBRO will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

## **7. FAQ**

**How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**<br>
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TimetaBRO home folder.

**Is TimetaBRO compatible with Mac and Linux operating systems, or is it Windows-specific?**<br>
TimetaBRO is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux! It runs on systems that support Java 11, so you can use it on your preferred platform.

**Can I import my friend's schedule from a different calendar application into TimetaBRO?**<br>
Nope! TimetaBRO does not offer a direct import feature for schedules from other calendar applications. You'll need to manually add your friends' schedules to TimetaBRO using the add command. Tedious, but we're on it!

**Is there a way to set recurring events for specific dates or weekdays, like every Tuesday, without manually adding them one by one?**<br>
Yes! You can add recurring events for specific weekdays in TimetaBRO using the `addschedule` command. This feature allows you to set events for particular days of the week, making it easier to input recurring events.

**What happens if I accidentally delete a friend or event in TimetaBRO? Is there a way to recover deleted data?**<br>
Sorry! TimetaBRO does not have a built-in data recovery feature. When you delete a friend or event, the data is permanently removed from the application. Do double-check before deleting something, or clearing your app!


**How can I customize the reminder settings for events added to TimetaBRO?**<br>
You can customize the reminder settings for events when adding them using the `addevent` command. The r/y or r/n option allows you to enable or disable reminders for specific events.

**Is there a way to share my TimetaBRO schedule with others or export it to a different format, such as a calendar file?**<br>
Nope! TimetaBRO currently does not support sharing schedules with others or exporting them to external formats. It primarily functions as a personal scheduling tool.

**Can I remove a specific event or schedule from my timetable or my friends' timetable?**<br>
Not yet! However, for now, you may set slightly different names for events with the same name, such as 'Meetup with Jason (1)' and 'Meetup with Jason (2)' so that you can select the specific event to delete later. If not, when you try to remove an event from the schedule, it will remove the one that you added first!

**If I have two events that overlap, can I add both of them to the calendar?**<br>
Nope! As TimetaBRO was designed to be a timetable management app, we would not be allowing overlapping events to be added into the timetable. You don't wanna double book your own time!

**Why do my event names automatically change to all capitalised letters?**<br>
We want to standardize the format of all event names to prevent users from accidentally adding multiple events wit the same names but in different formats! (i.e. only first letter is capitalised vs only last letter is capitalised)

**Why can't I put 0000 instead of 2400 when my event ends at 12AM?**<br>
This is because it makes it hard for TimetaBRO to understand that it ends at 12AM the next day! Hence, 2400 is a workaround for this. Stay tuned for enhancements!

## **8. Known issues**

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen :( But don't worry! The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again! Simple!

2. **The timetable only supports timings in 30-minute gaps** because this is an app made for NUS students! Since NUS timetables are set in 30-minute gaps, we have adapted this to better fit the NUS timetable style.

3.  While you **can't select a specific event to delete**, don't sweat it. We've got you covered. The events are removed in the order they were added, following a first-in-first-out basis. So, the earliest added event will be the first to bid farewell! 

4.  You can currently put birthdays in the future. Not to worry if you accidentally mistype your friends birthday! You use the edit command to rectify any future birthdays. 

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!
