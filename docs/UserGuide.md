## 4. Features

This section of the User Guide will explain about each feature in detail.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Notes about the inputs:**

- Commands are **case-insensitive**.
- Many of the commands below have _aliases_, or short-form versions that make them easier to type.  
  For example, the command `addMember` can be typed as `addm`. Usages of the aliases are documented below alongside the
  full command word, and all aliases can be used interchangeably with the full command word.
- Words in UPPER_CASE are input parameters that you need to provide for that specific field.  
  For example, in `addm /name NAME`, `NAME` would be the input parameter for the member's name.
- Fields in square brackets `[ ]` are optional fields.
- Parameters can be in any order.  
  For example, `adda /name Taylor Swift /phone 91961969` and `adda /phone 91691969 /name Taylor Swift` will result in
  the same applicant added.
- Items with … after them can be used multiple times including zero times.  
  For example, [tag/TAG]… can be used as (i.e. 0 times), tag/SWE, tag/UIUX tag/Product etc.
