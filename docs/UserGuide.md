## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: How to interpret each feature description:** <br>

The description of each feature is divided into 6 parts:

* **Name** - The name of the feature.
* **Scenario** - A scenario that illustrates when and why the feature is useful.
* **Format** - The format of the command for the feature.
* **Examples** - Examples of using the command and their effects.
* **Things to Note** - Any additional information that the user should take note of when using the feature.
* **Outcomes** - The expected successful and failed outcomes.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:** <br>

When looking at the command format of each feature the first time, it might seem confusing. But, they all follow a general pattern, and here is the explanation of the pattern with an example of adding a musician contact to the application:

```
add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG]…​  [i/INSTRUMENT]…​  [g/GENRE]…​ 
```

* The first word represents the command name, in this case, `add`.

* The words in uppercase represent the [parameters](#glossary) to be provided by the user, and their meanings are self-explanatory. For example, `n/NAME` means you need to provide a name for the contact.

* The prefixes like `n/`, `p/`, `e/` are used to identify the parameters. So, when typing `add n/John Doe`, the application knows that `John Doe` is the name of the musician.

* The parameters in square brackets like `[g/GENRE]` are optional, while the parameters without square brackets like `n/NAME` are compulsory.

* The parameters in with `…​` like `[g/GENRE]…​` can be entered multiple times (including zero times). For example, `g/rock g/jazz` or `g/blues` or `​` are all valid.

* The order of the parameters does not affect the result. For example, `p/PHONE_NUMBER` can be entered before `n/NAME`, and the command still works the same.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, or `tags`) will be ignored.

### Features for managing musicians

#### Add musician: `add`

**Scenario:** 

You have just met a talented musician and see him/her as a potential fit for your dream band. Let's add him/her to your contact list.

**Format:** 

`add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG]…​ [i/INSTRUMENT]…​ [g/GENRE]…​`

**Examples:**
* `add n/Hans Leonhart p/98765432 e/hansl@music.com t/german i/violin g/classical` 

   This command adds Hans Leonhart to your contact list. He plays the violin and specialises in classical music. He is also one of the few German musicians you know.

**Things to Note**
* To add the instruments and genres the musician specialises in using the `i/` and `g/` prefixes, you can only add the ones included in a [pre-defined list](#list-of-valid-instrumentsgenres) of instruments and genres. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

    ```
    This musician already exists in your contact list
    ```
2. If you provide invalid arguments for any of the parameters (name, email, etc.) you will be shown the corresponding error message with the correct format to follow. Please re-enter the correct information.

[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Delete musician: `delete`

Deletes a musician from your contact list.

**Scenario:**

You have just found out that a musician contact is outdated and no longer relevant. Let's find his/her index in the `My Musicians` panel and delete him/her from your list.

**Format:** 

`delete INDEX`

**Examples:**
* `delete 1`

   This command deletes the musician at index 1 in the `My Musicians` panel.

**Upon success:**

You will see a message indicating successful removal of the musician contact in the musician panel like below:

```
Deleted Musician: Hans Leonhart; Phone: 98765432; 
Email: hansl@music.com; Tags: [german]; 
Instruments: [violin]; Genres: [classical]
```

**Upon failure:**

Should you input an index out of the range of the current `My Musicians` list, you will see the error message below:

```
The musician index provided is invalid
```
Please verify that the index is correct and try again.

[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Edit musician: `edit`

**Scenario:**

You have just found out that a musician contact has changed his/her phone number and email. Let's edit his/her contact information.

**Format:** 

`edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG]…​  [i/INSTRUMENT]…​  [g/GENRE]…​ `

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 p/98765430 g/pop`

   This command edits the phone number of the musician at index 1 in the `My Musicians` panel to 98765430 and changes his/her preferred genre to pop.

**Things to Note**
* At least one of the optional field to edit must be provided.
* The `INDEX` refer to the index number shown in the **currently displayed** `My Musicians` list. The index must be a positive integer, e.g. 1, 2, 3, …​
* If you would like to edit a musician not currently shown, please use the `list` command first before editing.
* When editing tags/instruments/genres, the existing tags/instruments/genres of the musician will be removed i.e adding of tags/instruments/genres is not cumulative.
* You can remove all tags/instruments/genres of the musician by inputting an empty tag/instrument/genre field, e.g. `edit 1 t/ i/ g/`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Tips:**

The syntax for `edit` command is identical to the `add` command except for the additional `INDEX` parameter.

</div>

**Upon success:**
A success message like below will be displayed.

```
Edited Musician: Hans Leonhart; Phone: 98765430; 
Email: hansl@music.com; Tags: [german]; 
Instruments: [violin]; Genres: [pop]

    ```
    At least one field to edit must be provided.
    ```
2. If you provide invalid arguments for any of the parameters (name, email, etc.) you will be shown the corresponding error message with the correct format to follow. Please re-enter the correct information.
3. If you have provided at least one optional field to edit in the correct format yet the index provided is out of range, you will see the error message below:
    ```
    The musician index provided is invalid
    ```
    Please verify that the index is correct and try again.
   
[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Find musicians: `find`

**Scenario:**

You are about to form a band and are looking for musicians who play certain instruments and specialises in certain genres. Let's find them in your contact list!

**Format:** 

`find [n/NAME]…​  [t/TAG]…​  [i/INSTRUMENT]…​  [g/GENRE]…​`

**Examples:**
* `find n/John n/Joe i/violin` 
    
   This command finds all musicians whose names contain "John" or "Joe" AND play the violin.

* `find t/available t/friendly i/piano g/jazz` 

    This command finds all musicians whose tags contain "available" or "friendly" AND play the piano AND specialises in jazz.

**Things to Note**
* At least one of the optional field to find must be provided.
* The argument for each field must contain only one word. It cannot be empty and cannot contain multiple words separated by whitespaces.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `john` will match `John`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `guit` will NOT match `guitar`

**Upon success:**

The `My Musicians` panel will update to show all matching musicians, while the `My Bands` panel will list all bands.

For example, when the input command is `find g/rock i/guitar i/piano`

`My Musicians` panel will display all 3 musicians whose genres contain "rock" AND instruments contain "guitar" or "piano"
![find_after.png](images%2Fmusician-features%2Ffind_after.png)

**Upon failure:**

1. If you provide no argument for the `find` command, you will see an error message indicating the command format is invalid with the correct format to follow.
2. If you provide empty arguments for any of the fields, e.g. `find n/ i/`, you will see an error message below:
    ```
    The argument(s) provided must not be empty.
    ```
3. If you provide arguments of more than one word separated by whitespaces for any of the fields, e.g. `find n/John Doe` you will see the error message below:
    ```
    The argument(s) provided must not contain more than one word.
    ```
   Please ensure the argument contains **one and only one word.**

### Features for managing bands

#### Create band: `addb`

**Scenario:**

Now, with all the musician contacts in your list, you are ready to create your first band!

**Format:** 

`addb n/BANDNAME [g/GENRE]…​`

**Examples:**
* `addb n/My Garage Band g/rock`

    This command creates a rock band named "My Garage Band".

**Things to Note:**
* The name of the band must be unique.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

Conditions for **unique** band name: Unique sequence of alphanumeric characters (case-insensitive)

</div>

* To add the genres the band specialises in using the `g/` prefix, you can only add the ones included in a [pre-defined list](#list-of-valid-instrumentsgenres) of genres.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

This command only creates an empty band with the specified name and genre. To add musicians to the band, please use the [addm](#add-musician-to-band-addm) command.

</div>

**Upon success:**

You will see a message indicating successful addition of the band like below:
```
New band added: My Garage Band; Genres: [rock]
```

**Upon failure:**

1. Should you input a band which is already in your contact book (i.e. have the same name as an 
existing band), you will see an error message showing the possible error. Please input a different name.
2. Should you try to add a band with invalid genre tags, i.e., `addb n/My Garage Band g/water` , you will see a message like below: 
    ```
    Genre tags names should be a valid genre name.
    For a list of valid genres, please use the command 'tags'
    ```

[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Add musician to band: `addm`

**Scenario:**

You have just created a band and are ready to experiment with some cool band makeups. Let's add some musicians to the band!

**Format:** 

`addm b/BAND_INDEX m/MUSICIAN_INDEX…​ `

**Examples:**
* `addm b/1 m/1 m/2 ` 

    This command adds the first and second musicians in the `My Musicians` contact list to the first band in the `My Bands` list.


**Things to Note:**
* `BANDINDEX` and `MUSICIANINDEX` must be positive integers 1, 2, 3, …​
* You can only add musicians to one band at a time. Adding musicians to multiple bands in a single command is currently not supported.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Tips:**

If you want to view all your musician contact that you can choose from, you can use the `list` command. If you want to filter musicians based on preferred genre, you may refer to `find` command. This allows you to identify musicians who are proficient in the same genre as the band requirement, and optimise your band makeup.

</div>

**Upon success:**

You will see a message indicating successful addition of the musician into the band. The `My Bands` panel will update to show **only** the band which the new musicians are added in. The `My Musicians` panel will update to show all **the members of that band.**

For example, when we want to add musicians to a blues/jazz band called "Neo Pixel" (3rd in band panel):
1. Let's first find all musicians who are proficient in blues or jazz with `find g/blues g/jazz`
   ![addm_filter.png](images%2Fband-features%2Faddm_filter.png)


2. Let's add all 4 musicians to band "Neo Pixel" with `addm b/3 m/1 m/2 m/3 m/4`.
 On the right, `My Bands` panel will display the band "Neo Pixel". On the left, `My Musicians` panel will display all musicians in that band.
![addm_after.png](images%2Fband-features%2Faddm_afteradding.png)

**Upon failure:**

1. Should you input an index that is out of range (e.g. musician index 4 when there are 3 musicians, or band index 2
when there is 1 band), you will see an error message below:
    ```
    The musician index provided is invalid
    ```
    or 
    ```
    The band index provided is invalid
    ```
2. If the musician(s) you are adding is/are already in the band, you will see an error message below:
    ```
    One or more of the musicians already exist in the band
    ```
3. If you input more than one field for the prefix `b/`, meaning you are trying to add musicians to multiple bands, e.g. `addm b/1 b/2 m/1`, you will see an error message below:
    ```
    You can only add musicians to one band at a time
    ```
   
[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Find band: `findb`

**Scenario:**

You have created a few bands and added several musicians to each band. Now, you would like to find a particular band and view all the members in it. 

**Format:** 

`findb BANDNAME`

**Examples:**
* `findb TheoryX` 

    This command finds the band named "theory X" and displays all the members in it.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

Please ensure that the band name does not contain extra whitespaces

</div>

**Upon success:**

On the left, `My Musicians` panel will display all musicians in the band. On the right, `My Bands` panel will display the band of interest.

For example, if we want to view all members in band "TheoryX" with command `findb TheoryX`
* Before: From `list` state
  ![findb_before.png](images%2Fband-features%2Flistall.png)


* After: On the left, `My Musicians` panel will display all musicians in "TheoryX". On the right, `My Bands` panel will display only "TheoryX".
  ![findb_after.png](images%2Fband-features%2Ffindb.png)

**Upon failure:**

If you input an invalid band name, you will see an error message as shown below.
```
Band does not exist!
```
Please input a valid band name and enter the command again.

[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Remove musician from band: `removem`

**Scenario:**

After experimenting with the band makeups, you may think that a musician is not a good fit for the band and would like to remove him/her from it.

**Format:** 

`removem b/BANDINDEX m/MUSICIANINDEX`

**Examples:**
* `removem b/1 m/1` 

    This command removes the first musician in the `My Musicians` contact list from the first band in the `My Bands` list.

**Things to Note:**
* `BANDINDEX` and `MUSICIANINDEX` must be positive integers 1, 2, 3, …​
* Unlike the `addm` command, you can only remove **one** musician from a band at a time. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Tips:**

You may want to use the [`findb`](#find-band-findb) command to view all the members of the band first before using this command.

</div>

**Upon success:**

On the left, `My Musicians` panel will correctly display all musicians in the band, without the deleted musician. On the right, `My Bands` panel will display the band of interest.

For example, we want to remove John Doe from band TheoryX.
* Before: First double-check the band members in TheoryX with `findb TheoryX`.
  ![findb_after.png](images%2Fband-features%2Ffindb.png)


* After: Remove John Doe at position 1 with `removem b/1 m/1`. You will see a message indicating successful removal of the musician from the band like below:
  ![removem_after.png](images%2Fband-features%2Fremovem_after.png)

**Upon failure:**

1. Should you input an index that is out of range (e.g. musician index 4 when there are 3 musicians, or band index 2
when there is 1 band), you will see an error message as shown below.
    ```
    The musician index provided is invalid
    ```
    Please input a valid index and try again.
2. If the musician does not exist in the band, you will see an error message as shown below.
    ```
    Musician (details of the musician omitted here) is not in the band
    ```
Please verify that the index of the musician is correct or input a different musician and try again.

[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Edit a band: `editb`

**Scenario:**

You may want to change the name of the band or add/remove the genres of the band as a whole besides adding/removing musicians from the band. This is just as easy as creating the band with `addb`, which you might have already done!

**Format:** 

`editb INDEX n/NEWNAME g/GENRE…​ `

**Examples:**
* `editb 1 n/Ace g/jazz`

    This command changes the name of the first band in the `My Bands` panel to "Ace" and its genre to "jazz".

**Upon success:**

You will see a message indicating successful editing of the first band in the band panel like below:

```
Edited Band: Ace; Genres: [jazz]
```

**Upon failure:**

1. Should you input an index out of the range of the current `My Bands` list, you will see the error message below:
    ```
    The band index provided is invalid
    ```
2. Should you attempt to change the name of the band to an existing band name stored by the program, you will see the error message below:
    ```
    This band already exists in the addressbook.
    ```
    Please verify that the index is correct and try again.
3. Should you try to specify an invalid genre for the band i.e. `editb 1 g/poP` , you will see a message like below:
    ```
    Genre tags names should be a valid genre name.
    For a list of valid genres, please use the command 'tags'
    ```
    Please refer to the [list of valid genres](#list-of-valid-instrumentsgenres) and try again.

[Back To ToC](#table-of-contents)

#### Delete a band: `deleteb`

**Scenario:**

You have finished experimenting with the band makeups and gotten your perfect band. Let's delete the rest of the bands since you no longer need them.

**Format:** 

`deleteb INDEX`

**Examples:**
* `deleteb 1`
    
    This command deletes the first band in the `My Bands` panel.

**Upon success:**

You will see a message indicating successful removal of the first band in the band panel like below:

```
Deleted Band: Ace; Genres: [jazz]
```

**Upon failure:**

Should you input an index out of the range of the current `My Bands` list, you will see the error message below:

```
The band index provided is invalid

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: How do I install Java 11?<br>
**A**: Follow this [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) for steps to download Java 11.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Go to the application's home directory and copy the `data/addressbook.json` file containing your data into the empty data folder created by BandConnect++ on the other computer.

**Q**: Why is BandConnect++ not displaying all musicians/bands?<br>
**A**: It's possible that the application may not be displaying all musicians/bands due to previous commands that have filtered either of the lists. If you're encountering this issue, consider using the [list command](#list-all-musicians-and-bands-list) to display all musicians and bands.

**Q**: What if I accidentally close BandConnect++ without using the exit command? Do I lost all my data?<br>
**A**: Not to worry! BandConnect++ automatically saves all data after each change you make, so no data is lost.

**Q**: What if I encounter a bug or want to suggest a new feature?<br>
**A**: We value all feedback from our users! Please open an issue to report a bug or suggest a feature on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp)

**Q**: Do I need an active internet connection to use BandConnect++?<br>
**A**: No, BandConnect++ does not require an internet connection to be used. However, you'll need an internet connection to download it.

**Q**: How do I check if I am using Java 11? <br>
**A**: The method to check the Java version you use will be different for every operating system.
* **Windows** users: <br>
  Click on the '**Windows**' key and search for '**Command Prompt**' <br>
* **Mac** users: <br>
  Click on '**F4**' and search for '**Terminal**'
* **Linux** users: <br>
  Click on '**Ctrl**' + '**Alt**' + '**T**' keys simultaneously
* Once the application is open, type `java -version` and hit '**Enter/ Return**'.
* The application should state your Java version, as shown below:
  ![java_version.png](images%2Fjava_version.png)
* If you do not see `11.__.__`, or if you do not have Java installed, follow the instructions [here](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk) to download **Java 11**.

| CLI       | Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer program by typing in commands through a keyboard. <br/> Since a mouse is not needed for CLI, it is often **a more efficient interaction method for fast typists.** |
| GUI       | Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a user interface that allows users to interact with the application using graphical elements like text fields, buttons, and menus.                                                                                                         |
| Parameter | Parameters are specific settings for you to customise your command. For example, the name and phone number of a musician are parameters.                                                                                                                                     |
| Command   | A command is an instruction given to the application to perform a specific action. For example, `list` is a command that displays all musicians and bands.                                                                                                                   |
| JAR       | A package of all resources for BandConnect++ to run. The only thing you need to download is the BandConnect++ JAR file!                                                                                                                                                      |
| JSON      | JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Index     | The position of something in a list. For example, the first item on your list in Bandconnect++ has an index of 1.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Java      | Java is the primary programming language used to develop and use **_BandConnect++_**. Installation of Java is required to successfully run the application.                                                                                                                  |
