CodeSphere is a **desktop contact management app, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface [(CLI)](#glossary)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface [(GUI)](#glossary).
It is an app targeted at Teaching Assistants (TAs) in the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing (SoC) to help them better manage administration of their students.

We understand that as a TA, you might often find it difficult to keep track of all your students' progress and administrative matters.
And that is why we have developed CodeSphere for you. With CodeSphere, you will have a simple and effect way to manage your students, allowing for customised support to keep tabs on each student.

It doesn't matter if you are a new or experienced TA, with CodeSphere, you can easily:
* Add a course that you teach.
* Then, add students into that course.

And to find out more about what else CodeSphere can do for you, continue to read the rest of this all-encompassing user guide.

## **Tutorial for Beginners**
*If you are not a beginner, or would like to explore CodeSphere on your own,
feel free to skip this tutorial or jump to whichever portion you require.*

### Tutorial Contents
1. [**Adding a course**](#tutorial-adding-a-course)
2. [**Adding students**](#tutorial-adding-students)
3. [**Adding remarks / pending questions**](#tutorial-adding-remarks--pending-questions)

**Let's explore CodeSphere's features through the eyes of a teaching assistant.**
When you open up the application for the first time, after a brief splash screen of the CodeSphere logo,
you will see CodeSphere's `home` page, with 6 pre-populated sample courses.

![Ui](images/tutorial/Tutorial_HomePage.png)

At the top of the application, there is an underlined portion that we will refer to as the *Command Line*.
This is where your commands are typed, and they are confirmed by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard.
Below the Command Line is the *Result Box* (which is the outlined box),
which will tell you the outcome of any commands that you have entered.
Lastly, underneath that is the *Display Panel*, which will be updated after each command is entered.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Tutorial: Adding a course

*(For demonstration purposes, we'll be using `CS2101` as our chosen course.
Feel free to replace this with any other course.)*

Let's begin by adding our course into the home page with the command `add c/CS2101`.
After pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, you will see a message informing you that there is a *New course added: CS2101* in the *Result Box* and the course `CS2101` will appear at the bottom of the list.
You will notice that an item number is displayed beside the course name (note the **7.** beside *CS2101* in the image), as well as some other information being displayed for each course, like the total number of students and total number of pending questions.

![CS1101S in Homepage](images/tutorial/AddCS2101.png)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Tutorial: Adding students

Next, let us add some students into our `CS2101` course.
To do that, we will first need to navigate into our `CS2101` course by using the command `select 7`, which selects the seventh course in the course list.

This will bring you to the course page for `CS2101` and your application should now change to look like the image below.
In the course page, the course list is now being displayed in the left column, while the right column that will be used to display students added to the selected course is currently empty because students have not been added into `CS2101`.

*Tip: You can always refer to the Result Box to see whether the command you entered has been successful.*

![Empty CS1101S](images/tutorial/SelectCS2101.png)

The student list for `CS2101` is currently empty, so let's add a few students into the list with the following commands:
*(Remember to press 'Enter' after each command)*
- `add n/John Tan e/e0123456@u.nus.edu t/good`
- `add n/Mary Lim e/e1234567@u.nus.edu t/average`
- `add n/David Lee e/e2345678@u.nus.edu t/poor`

>:information_source: Note: When creating students, you must always include their name (`n/`), email (`e/`) and performance tag (`t/`).

![Filled CS1101S](images/tutorial/course_students.png)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Tutorial: Adding remarks / pending questions

Lastly, let's take a look at how we can add remarks or pending questions for a student.
To start, try adding the remark "Will be 15 minutes late for tutorial" to *John Tan* who is the first student in the list, 
by typing `remark 1 r/Will be 15 minutes late for tutorial`.

Similarly, let's note down Mary's pending question about "Tutorial 2 Question 4" through the command `pq 2 pq/Tutorial 2 Question 4`.

Your page should now be updated with the remark and pending question added to John and Mary respectively.

![Add Remark and PQ](images/tutorial/remark_pq.png)

And with that, you have now successfully created your first course, added a few students, and even noted down some extra information for your students.

>:bulb: As a final tip, you can use the directional ***UP*** and ***DOWN*** keys on your keyboard to access the commands that
you have previously entered.

Now that you know how CodeSphere works, feel free to explore some other features that have been specially curated for you to manage your students with ease, such as
[listing out all students with pending questions](#list-all-pending-questions--list),
[sorting the students by different criteria](#sorting-all-students--sort) or even
[finding students with certain keywords in selected field](#finding-a-student--find).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Adding a student : `add`
Adds a student to the list of students in the selected course.

**Format:** `add n/NAME e/EMAIL t/TAG`
* `NAME`: Student names can only contain alphabets and some special characters (, / - ‘). Note that alphabets in the input for `NAME` are case-sensitive.
* `EMAIL`: NUS undergraduate student’s email, in the format of "exxxxxxx@u.nus.edu". Note that the alphabets in the input for`EMAIL` are case-insensitive, and they will all be stored and displayed as uppercase letters. For example, using `e/e1234567@u.nus.edu` or `e/E1234567@U.NUS.EDU` will both result in `e1234567@u.nus.edu` being added as a student's `EMAIL`.
* `TAG`: Represents a student's performance level in the selected course. Valid performance tags include `GOOD`, `AVERAGE` and `POOR`. Note that the input for `TAG` is case-insensitive, and they will all be stored and displayed as uppercase letters. For example, using `t/good` or `t/GOOD` will both result in `GOOD` being added as a student's `TAG`.

**Examples:**
* `add n/Susan Tan e/e0946283@u.nus.edu t/GOOD`
* `add n/Koh Mei Ling, Mary e/e9739423@u.nus.edu t/AVERAGE`

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### Editing a student : `edit`

Edits the details of an existing student from the list of students in the selected course.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG] [r/REMARK] [pq/PENDING_QUESTION]`
* `INDEX`: Refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. It must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), and it should fall within the range of students currently displayed such that it corresponds to a valid student.
* All fields after `INDEX` are optional, as indicated by square brackets [ ]. But **at least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* Field(s) specified in the command will replace existing field(s) for the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* The inputs for each field should not contain other valid prefixes. For example, `edit 1 r/new remark e/o`, where the `REMARK` field is intended to be `new remark e/o`, is not allowed because the valid prefix `e/` for `EMAIL` is included in the input for the `REMARK` field.
* Note that when editing tags/remarks/pending questions, the respective existing fields of the student will be removed, meaning that adding of tags/remarks/pending questions is not cumulative.

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 t/good` edits the tag of the first student in the displayed student list to be GOOD.
* `edit 2 n/Alex Yeoh t/average` edits the name of the second student to be Alex Yeoh and changes the tag to AVERAGE.
* `edit 3 r/participative` edits the remark of the third student to be "participative".
* `edit 4 pq/what is a logic gate? n/David Lee` returns the following result:
*![Edit_Student](images/CommandSuccessScreenshots/EditStudentSuccess.png)*

### Adding a remark for a student : `remark`

Adds a remark to the specified student from the list of students in the selected course.

**Format:** `remark INDEX r/REMARK`
* `INDEX`: Refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. It must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), and it should fall within the range of students currently displayed such that it corresponds to a valid student.
* The inputs for `REMARK` will be added to the `REMARK` field for the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* Note that the inputs for `REMARK` cannot be empty.
* Note that the adding of a `REMARK` is not cumulative. If the current `REMARK` field is not empty, using the `remark` command again will overwrite what is in the current `REMARK` field.

**Example:**
* `remark 2 r/needs more help` adds a remark to the student at index 2 of the displayed students list saying needs more help.
* `remark 1 r/late submission` returns the following result:
*![Add_Remark](images/CommandSuccessScreenshots/RemarkSuccess.png)*

### Adding a pending question for a student : `pq`

Adds a pending question to the specified student from the list of students in the selected course.

**Format:** `pq INDEX pq/PENDING_QUESTION`
* `INDEX`: Refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. It must be a positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), and it should fall within the range of students currently displayed such that it corresponds to a valid student.
* The inputs for `PENDING_QUESTION` will be added to the `PENDING_QUESTION` field for the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* Note that the inputs for `PENDING_QUESTION` cannot be empty.
* Note that the adding of a `PENDING_QUESTION` is not cumulative. If the current `PENDING_QUESTION` field is not empty, using the `pq` command again will overwrite what is in the current `PENDING_QUESTION` field.

**Example:**
* `pq 2 pq/What is a logic gate?` adds a pending question to the student at index 2 of the displayed student, with the question “What is a logic gate?”. This indicates a need to follow-up with the student.

* The fields after `INDEX` are optional, as indicated by square brackets [ ]. But **at least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* `remove` clears the field(s) specified for the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* Note that nothing should be specified after `r/` or `pq/`.

**Examples:**
* `remove 2 pq/` Removes a pending question of the student at index 2 of the displayed students list.

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CodeSphere home folder.

## **Known Issues**

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen,
   the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the application before running the application again.
