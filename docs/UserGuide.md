# Tutorium User Guide

Welcome to Tutorium! Tutorium is a **desktop application for tuition centre administrative staff** to conduct data analysis for the planning of marketing strategies. Users can interact with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

<box type="info" seamless>

**What is CLI?**<br>
Command line interface (CLI) is an interface we use to interact with the computer using only the keyboard and text.

In contrast, a graphical user interface (GUI) is how you interact with the computer using a mouse, finding and clicking menus, buttons and icons.

**Why CLI?**<br>

CLI enables you to execute commands quickly and work more efficiently!

</box>

Tutorium supports administrative work relating to students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4, under the O-Level and IP systems in Singapore.

In this user guide, you will find instructions on how to install Tutorium and use its many features to manage and make use of the students' data.
From having Tutorium installed to making the best use out of Tutorium, this user guide has everything you need. Head over to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to get onboard!

Choose a topic from the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) below to find out how to use Tutorium!

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [s/SUBJECT]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/English` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SUBJECT]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/English`, `s/English s/Chinese` etc.

* When providing parameters starting with any of the prefixes used by Tutorium `(n/, p/, e/, a/, g/, l/, n/, s/, d/ and y/)` to fields,
  users should not add spaces between the prefix for that field and the input value.
  e.g. Filtering students with the address `e/house` should be done with the command `filter a/e/house` rather than `filter a/ e/house`.

* Parameters containing 2 or more words require only the first word to start with the prefixes used by Tutorium `(n/, p/, e/, a/, g/, l/, n/, s/, d/ and y/)`
  e.g. n/John Doe, <span style='color: red;'>NOT</span> n/John n/Doe

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* For commands that take in index (e.g. delete, edit), the index can only be an integer from 1 to 2,147,483,647, otherwise an invalid command message will be displayed.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Valid subject names are: `English, Chinese, Elementary Mathematics, Advanced Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, History, Geography and Social Studies`.

* The accepted range of sec levels is from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4.

* If no enrol date is provided, the date on which the command was executed will be applied to all subjects listed in the command.
    * If only 1 enrol date is provided, the same enrol date will be applied to all subjects listed.
    * If the number of enrol dates provided is the same as the number of subjects listed, the order in which enrol dates are applied to subjects will be the same as the order in which they are provided.
    * Any mismatch between the number of subjects and the number of enrol dates provided (other than the cases listed above) will result in an error.

* Simply providing 1 enrol date without providing any corresponding subject(s) will result in an error.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
