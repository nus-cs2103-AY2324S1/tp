# Class Manager 2023 User Guide

Class Manager 2023 (CM 23) is a **desktop app for managing your students' contacts in the class,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CM 23 can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `class-manager-2023.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClassManager.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar class-manager-2023.jar` command to run the application.
   Note the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all student details.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com s/A0245234A c/T11` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the Class Manager.

   * `delete s/A0245234A` : Deletes the student with student number A0245234A, which is added in the previous step.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. To begin using Class Manager, configure Class Manager with your module information using the `config` command. For example:
   * `config #t/10 #a/1` configures Class Manager to have 10 tutorials and 1 assignment.

7. That's it! You can now explore Class Manager! Refer to the [Commands](#commands) below for details of each command. <br>
   You can also refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary-in-alphabetical-order).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## GUI Overview

<img alt="Gui" src="images/Ui.png" width="600"> </br>

The **GUI** is split up into 4 main sections.

1. **Command Box** - (_Located at the top with the text "Enter command here..."_) This is where you can type in commands to execute.
2. **Result Display** - (_Located below command box_) This is where the results of the commands and any errors will be displayed.
3. **Student List** - (_Located on the bottom left_) This is where the list of students will be displayed.
4. **Student Details** - (_Located on the bottom right_) This is where the details of the selected student will be displayed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME c/CLASS_NUMBER`, `c/CLASS_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that **do not** take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that **do** take in parameters will be considered as invalid. <br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `delete 123 s/A0249112A` or `delete s/A0249112A c/t11`, it will be considered as invalid. <br>
  Please **<u>refrain</u>** from using prefixes as input under another prefix.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

### Class Number

* Class Number refers to the tutorial class number of a particular course. 
* Class Number is not case-sensitive, and it must begin with 1 to 3 alphabet letters, followed by 1 to 5 digits, and end with an optional single alphabetical character. Class Number must not be blank.
* Here are some valid examples of Class Number:
    - `G11`
    - `T11A`
    - `SG10`
    - `ABC12345D`

### Student Number

* Student Number refers to the unique matriculation number of a NUS student. In Class Manager, it must begin with the letter 'A' or 'a', followed by 1 or more digits, and end with a single alphabetical character. Student Number must not be blank as well.
* Class Manager uses the Student Number to uniquely identify each student in most commands. The Student Number is not case-sensitive. e.g. Student Number `A123V` and `A123v` refers to the same student.

### Command navigation

* Class Manager allows you to navigate to previously entered commands using the arrow keys. Navigate to earlier commands using the **up arrow** key, and later commands using the **down arrow** key.

## Commands

### Configuring Class Manager : `config`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
Configuring Class Manager resets the class details (grades, attendance and class participation details) of all students, as well as the past states of Class Manager. This **cannot** be undone using the `undo` command. It is recommended to configure Class Manager before adding students.
</box>

Before you begin using Class Manager, it is recommended that you configure the number of tutorials and assignments that your module has. This can be done using the `config` command, and allows Class Manager to automatically generate the correct number of class details fields for each student. <br><br>
Class Manager can be configured _at any time_, but do take note of the warning above regarding **loss** of student data and past Class Manager states. If you configure Class Manager after adding students, each student will have the correct number of tutorials and assignments. However, their class details data will be **reset** and there will be no previous states of Class Manager you can return to via the `undo` command.

Format: `config #t/TUTORIAL_COUNT #a/ASSIGNMENT_COUNT`

* `TUTORIAL_COUNT` and `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` must be a positive integer between 1 and 40 inclusive.
* Inputting the same `TUTORIAL_COUNT` or `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` as the previous configuration will also **reset** the class details of all students.

Examples:
* `config #t/13 #a/1`
* `config #a/4 #t/39`

---

### Viewing help : `help`

Opens the help window that shows a summary of all commands and its parameters, with a `Copy URL` button that provides access to this help page.

---

### Tagging a student : `tag`

Tags the existing student in Class Manager.

Format: `tag s/STUDENT_NUMBER [/add] [/delete] t/[TAG]…​`

* Tags the student with the specified `STUDENT_NUMBER`.
* When editing tags without `/add` or `/delete`, the existing tags of the student will be overwritten.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
_At least one_ of the optional fields must be provided. `lookup` alone is not allowed. <br>
This command will not check for field validation. e.g. `lookup c/class 11` is allowed even though `class 11` is not a valid class number.
</box>

* The command is **case-insensitive**. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only **full words** will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Class Manager 2023 home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
