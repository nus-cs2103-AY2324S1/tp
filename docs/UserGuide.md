HouR is a **desktop app for managing employee records, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HouR can get your HR management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `hour.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your employee list.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hour.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `help`: Shows help window with link to user guide.

   * `add n/John Doe pos/Senior Software Enginner id/EID2023-7890 p/81239876 e/johndoe@test.com s/$5,000` : Adds an employee named `John Doe` to the employee list.

   * `list` : Lists all employees.
   
   * `edit 1 n/Alex Yeoh`: Edits the name of the 1st employee shown in the current list to `Alex Yeoh`.
   
   * `find Alex`: Lists all employees with the keyword `Alex`.

   * `delete EID1234-5678` : Deletes the employee with employee id EID1234-5678 shown in the list.

   * `sort by/Salary`: Sorts the employees by their salaries in ascending order.
   * 
   * `clear` : Deletes all employees.

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [pos/POSITION] [id/EMPLOYEE_ID] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [s/SALARY] [d/DEPARTMENT]...` can be used as `edit 1 n/John Doe` or as `edit 1 pos/Software Engineer`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/POSITION`, `p/POSITION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HouR home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
