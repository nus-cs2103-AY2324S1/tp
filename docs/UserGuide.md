# FumbleLog Tutorial
This tutorial is designed for new users looking to get started using FumbleLog. In this tutorial, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to use commands in FumbleLog to help you manage
your contacts and events.

1. First launch FumbleLog. You may refer to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide if you have forgotten how to.
2. Let's first try **adding a person**, `Mary Lee`, to your contact list. Enter the command: `add_person n/Mary Lee p/91234567 e/mary@gmail.com a/Mary Street #01-01 b/2001-12-12 g/Family`. You should see FumbleLog successfully adding the contact to the contact list:
![Tutorial Add](images/tutorialAdd.png)
3. Now, lets try **editing the name and email** of your contact. Let's use the index of `Mary Lee` shown in the list (in this case 1), and edit her information: `edit_person 1 n/John Doe e/John@gmail.com`. FumbleLog should reflect the changes to your contact immediately:
![Tutorial Edit](images/tutorialEdit.png)
4. Try adding a few more contacts and assign them to the same `Family` group using the `g/` parameter. Your contact list should look something like this:
![Tutorial Add More](images/tutorialAddMore.png)
5. Now, lets say `John`'s birthday is in a few weeks. We can **add this event** to FumbleLog using this command: `add_event m/John birthday d/2023-12-12`.
![Tutorial Event Add](images/tutorialEventAdd.png)
6. If everyone in the `Family` group is attending `John`'s birthday, you can easily assign every contact in the group to the event. In this case, simply **edit the event** by assigning the `Family` group, as such: `edit_event 1 g/Family`. Now you should see everyone in the `Family` group is assigned to `John`'s birthday.
![Tutorial Event Edit](images/tutorialEventEdit.png)
7. Finally, once the event is over, you can **delete the event** by using the index of the event (in this case 1): `delete_event 1`.
8. **Well done! üëç** You have mastered the basics of FumbleLog! You can now visit the [Features](#features) section to learn advanced commands!

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied with the command.<br>
  e.g. in `add_person n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_person n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [g/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe g/family` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times (or not at all).<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [g/GROUP]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `n/John Doe` (i.e. 0 times), `n/John Doe g/friend`, `n/John Doe g/friend g/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Invalid prefixes, such as `t/` will be regarded as a part of the input, for example `n/John Doe t/friend`, the name 
  will be parsed as `John Doe t/friend` instead of `John Doe`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list_all`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If any of the commands provided are invalid/do not follow the necessary format, an error message will be displayed.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Below are some examples on how to use the `edit_person` command:**

*  `edit_person 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`: Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit_person 3 n/Betsy Crower b/2023-09-29`: Edits the name of the 3rd person to be `Betsy Crower` and changes the birthday to 29th Sep 2023. Any events that Betsy Crower is assigned to is also updated with this new name.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on the `edit_person`command:**<br>
* At least one of the parameters must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values for all values except for `GROUP`
  * Parameters `p/`, `e/`, `a/` and `b/` can be empty strings. Doing so will clear the current values for the respective fields. i.e. `edit_person 1 a/` will remove the current `ADDRESS`.
  * Parameter `g/` is used to **assign a person** to a group. If the person is already assigned to the group, the group will not be added again.
  * Parameter `ug/` is used to **unassign a person** from a group. Once unassigned, the person's name will not be displayed in events that the group is assigned to.
* When you edit a person's name, the person's name will be updated in all [events](#commands-for-events) that the person is assigned to. Same for groups if the person's group is assigned to events.
* There will not be an error shown in the case that you edit a person's values to be the same as it currently is. i.e. if the first person's name on the person list is Alex, `edit_person 1 n/Alex` is a valid command and will not show an error message.

</div>


**Expected output when the command succeeds:**
* Input: `edit_person 1 n/Alexa Yeoh` changes the name of the 1st person to be `Alexa Yeoh`, leaving the rest of the fields unchanged.
  ![Editperson](images/Editperson.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Disclaimer: Editing a person with a filtered contacts list might cause the person to disappear. Do not worry, your data is not deleted.**<br>

- Lets say you used the command `find_person Alex`, to show all the persons with `Alex` in their name.  See: [find_person](#locating-persons-by-name-or-group-findperson)
- The person list is filtered to show all the persons with `Alex` in their name.
- You then edit the person `Alex`'s name to `Bob`.
- `Alex` will disappear from the person list, because your previous search term `Alex` no longer matches the new name of the person, `Bob`.
- To see `Bob` in the person list again, you can use the [`list_persons`](#listing-all-persons--listpersons) command to bring back the whole list of persons.
- In contrast with the above scenario, using an [`add_person`](#adding-a-person-addperson) command will automatically bring back the whole list of persons, to show you that your new person has been added to FumbleLog.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a person : `delete_person`

FumbleLog allows you to organize your contact list by deleting contacts that are no longer relevant.

Format: `delete_person PERSON_INDEX`

**Acceptable values for each parameter:**

| Parameter      | Format                                             | Example |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `PERSON_INDEX` | An index in the currently displayed contacts list. | `1`     |


**Below are some examples on how to use `delete_person` command:**

* `list_all` followed by `delete_person 2`: Deletes the 2nd person in the person list.
* `find_all Betsy` followed by `delete_person 1`: Deletes the 1st person in the filtered list as a result of the `find` command. i.e Any person named `Betsy` at index `1` will be deleted.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on `delete_person` command:**<br>
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* When a person is deleted, any [events](#commands-for-events) that the person is assigned to will also be updated, i.e. the person will be unassigned from the event.

</div>

**Expected output when the command succeeds:**

Input: `delete_person 1` deletes the first person on the list.

* The search is **case-insensitive**. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned.
  e.g. `find_person Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Expected output when the command succeeds:**

Input: `find_person Alexa` displays all contacts with the name `Alexa` in the contact list.

allowing you to add events. You can also choose to assign existing contacts or groups to each event.

Format: `add_event m/EVENT_NAME d/DATE [s/START_TIME] [e/END_TIME] [n/PERSON_NAME]... [g/GROUP]...`

**Acceptable values for each parameter:**

| Parameter                   | Format                                                                                    | Example           |

**Below are some examples on how to use `add_event` command:**

* `add_event m/FumbleLog presentation d/2023-10-30`: Adds an event with name `FumbleLog presentation` and with date `2023-10-30`.
* `add_event m/CS2101 OP2 d/2023-10-05 s/1500 e/1700 n/Ken g/CS2103T g/CS2101`: Adds an event with name `CS2101 OP2`, with date `2023-10-05`, with start time `1500`, with end time `1700`, assigns contact with name `Ken` and groups `CS2103T`, `CS2101` to the event.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on `add_event` command:**<br>
- `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` are optional.
- `PERSON_NAME` and `GROUP` is optional. 
-  Multiple persons and groups can be added at once, however only existing groups and persons can be added.
- The provided values for `DATE`, `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` must represent future date and time; past values are not allowed.
- The given `START_TIME` must be before the given `END_TIME`.
- If the meeting is added successfully, it will automatically be sorted by date and time with the earliest meeting at the top of the list.
- Note that if a person appears under multiple groups, e.g `Alvin` is in groups `classmates` and `friends`, the name `Alvin` will appear under both groups when displayed in the events list. This is an intended behavior for you to see everyone in the groups that are assigned to the event.<br>
This is illustrated as follows:

### Editing an event : `edit_event`

If the details of an event has changed or if you have made a mistake when adding an event, FumbleLog allows you to easily edit your event details with the latest updated information. You can use this command
to assign more contacts or groups to the event using the `n/` or `g/` parameter respectively, or unassign contacts or groups using `u/` or `ug/` respectively.

Format: `edit_event EVENT_INDEX [m/EVENT_NAME] [d/DATE] [s/START_TIME] [e/END_TIME] [n/PERSON_NAME]... [u/PERSON_NAME]... [g/GROUP]... [ug/GROUP]...`

**Acceptable values for each parameter:**

| Parameter                   | Format                                                                                    | Example           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `EVENT_INDEX`               | An index in the currently displayed events list.                                          | `1`               |
| `EVENT_NAME`                | Use `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and whitespaces only.                                             | `CS2103T meeting` |
| `DATE`                      | Have format `yyyy-MM-dd` and should not be earlier than current date.                     | `2023-12-01`      |
| `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` | Have format `HHmm`. `START_TIME` should be earlier than `END_TIME`.                       | `1400`            |
| `PERSON_NAME`               | Multiple persons can be assigned to an event but only existing persons name can be added. | `John Doe`        |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Below are some examples on how to use `edit_event` command:**

* `edit_event 1 m/FumbleLog meeting`: Edits the name of event at index 1 to `FumbleLog meeting`.
* `edit_event 1 s/1500 e/1700`: Edits the start and end time to `1500` and `1700` respectively. If the event initially does not have a start and end time, the respective times will be added to the event.
* `edit_event 1 u/Ken`: Unassigns the person `Ken` from the event.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes on `edit_event` command:**<br>
* At least one of the optional parameters required.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values, except for `PERSON` AND `GROUP`.
* Only parameters `s/` and `e/` can be empty strings. Doing so will remove the current values. i.e. `edit_event 1 s/` will remove the current `START_TIME`.
* `PERSON` and `GROUP` edits are cumulative and will add to the current list of persons and groups.
* The given `DATE`, `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` cannot be a time in the past.
* Note that if a person appears under multiple groups, e.g `Alvin` is in groups `classmates` and `friends`, the name `Alvin` will appear under both groups when displayed in the events list. This is an intended behavior for you to see everyone in the groups that are assigned to the event.<br>
This is illustrated as follows:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:exclamation: Disclaimer: Editing a person with a filtered contacts list might cause the person to disappear. Do not worry, your data is not deleted.**<br>

- Let say you have an event named `TP meeting` stored in FumbleLog and you used `find_event meeting`. See: [find_event](#locating-events-by-name-group-or-person-findevent)
- The event list will be filtered to show all the persons with `meeting` in their name.
- You then edit `TP meeting` event's name to `TP sprint`.
- `TP meeting` disappears from the person list, because your previous search term `meeting` no longer matches the new event name, `TP sprint`.
- To see `TP sprint` in the event list again, you can use the [list_events](#listing-all-events-listevents) command to bring back the whole list of events.
- In contrast with the above scenario, using an [add_event](#adding-an-event--addevent) command will automatically bring back the whole list of events, to show you that your new event has been added to FumbleLog.

# How we manage your data

### Saving the data

FumbleLog data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

FumbleLog data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FumbleLog will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: 
  Step 1: Install the app in the other computer
  Step 2: Go to your previous computer and obtain your old data file. You can find it at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. 
  Step 3: Copy the file from step 2 and move it to the data folder in your new computer, by replacing the new empty data file.
  Your data is now all restored!
**Q**: What are the constraints for email addresses?<br>
**A**: Emails should be of the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to the following constraints:
  1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters (like '+' and '_'). 
The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
  2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. 
The domain name must:
     + end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
     + have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
     + have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
