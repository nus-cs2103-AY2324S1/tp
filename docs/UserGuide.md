<a name="addi"></a>
#### Adding an interview to an applicant: `addi`

Adds a new interview to an applicant. In the case of duplicate names, the system will automatically increment the last 
number in the user input until it hits a unique input, or add 1 if there is no number. However, if the input is too
large, or there are too many duplicates, the system might throw a message asking you to handle it manually without 
handling it for you.

<box type="info" header="**Note**">
The name change is permanent so removing previous interviews will not change back the name. That is if both
<code>technical1</code> and <code>technical2</code> exist, deleting <code>technical1</code> will not change <code>technical2</code> back to <code>technical1</code>.
</box>

Duplicate handling: 
* Entering `technical12`, then `technical12` again will result in the 2nd entry being converted to 
`technical13`.
* Entering `technical`, `technical1`, then `technical` again will result in the 2nd `technical` entry being 
converted to `technical2`.
* Entering `technical`, then `technical` again will result in the 2nd entry being converted to `technical1`.

Format: `addi INDEX t/TYPE [r/RATING]`
* Adds an interview to the applicant at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed applicant list.
* A maximum of 5 interviews can be added to each applicant.
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`, ...).

<box type="tip" header="**Tip**">
    Rating will be rounded to the nearest 1 decimal place if more than 1 decimal place is provided.
</box>

Valid examples:
* `addi 3 t/screening` adds a _screening_ interview without rating to the 3rd person in the displayed applicant list.
* `addi 1 t/technical r/8.5` adds a _technical_ interview with rating 8.5 to the 1st person in the displayed applicant list, as shown in the GUI below.

![addi.png](images/user-guide/addi.png)

Invalid examples:
* `addi 1` is not allowed as `TYPE` is a required parameter and must be specified.

* `INDEX` and `INTERVIEW_INDEX` must be a positive integer (e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`, ...).

<box type="warning" header="**Caution**">
    There is <b>NO</b> duplicate handling for the name of the interview in <code>editi</code> and attempting to do so will give an error message.
</box>

Valid examples:
* `editi 1 i/1 t/technical r/7.8` edits the 1st interview of the 1st person in the displayed applicant list to a _technical_ interview with rating 7.8.

**A**: Install Staff-Snap on the other computer and replace the data file `[JAR file location]/data/applicantBook.json` in the other computer with the data file from your current computer. 

**Q**: How do I transfer my spreadsheet data to Staff-Snap? <br>
**A**: Export your spreadsheet data as a [CSV](#glossary) file, then use the [`import`](#import) command to import your CSV file into Staff-Snap. Ensure that your CSV file has the correct format and headers.
