## Definitions

This section provides an introduction to the terminology used in this user guide. 

### Medicine

A medicine is the item to be packaged and delivered as part of fulfilling an order.

A Medicine has the following attribute:
- Full Name
- Short form (Optional)

Medicines are uniquely identified by their full and short form names. No two medicines can have the same names.

### Person

A person refers to the patient whom the pharmacist is addressing.

A person has the following attributes:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email Address
- Address
- Allergies (Can be zero or more)
- Tags (Optional for additional remarks/inputs for the person. Can be zero or more)

A person is uniquely identified by their name. No two persons can have the same name and names are case-insensitive.

### Order

An order refers to a purchase of one or more medicines by a particular person.

An Order has the following attributes:
- Order Number
- Person (Who the order belongs to)
- Medicines (Can be one or more)
- Status of the order

Orders are uniquely identified by their order numbers. No two orders can have the same order number.<br/>
Orders can only be created for people that have been added into the PharmHub system. <br />
No order containing a medicine that the person is allergic to can be added without a special flag.  <br/>
Orders will automatically tag under the <span style="color: red;">PENDING</span> Status when added.

### Status

Status is used to describe the process at which the order is at.
Statuses can only be updated/modified following their chronological order.<br/>

<span style="background-color: red; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">PENDING/PD</span>
->
<span style="background-color: blue; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">PREPARING/PR</span>
->
<span style="background-color: green; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">COMPLETED/CP</span>
->
<span style="background-color: black; border-radius: 20%; padding: 1px; color: white">CANCELED/CC</span>

Statuses can be identified either in their full form or in their short form as shown above (FullForm/ShortForm). <br/>
Statuses are case-insensitive.

### Fields
* Fields are the different parts of a command.  
e.g. in `editp 1 n/Alex no/penicillin`, there are four fields: `editp`, `1`, `Alex`, and `penicilllin`.    
* Excess spaces will be ignored.
As such `Alex Yeoh` will produce the same result as `Alex     Yeoh`  
* To input a `/` character in a field, use another `/` before it.   
If there is an odd  number of consecutive `/`, one of them will be ignored.  
  e.g To input `Roy s/o Balakrishnan`, use `Roy s//o Balakrishnan`

The following fields are used for commands:

| Field         | Prefix | Format                                                                                                        | Example                                    |

Examples:
* `findo m/Panadol m/Ibuprofen` returns all orders with either `Panadol` or `Ibuprofen`.
* `findo s/pd m/Panadol` returns all orders that is both <span style="color: red;">PENDING</span> and contains `Panadol`.
* `findo s/pd m/pan m/pen` returns all orders that is both <span style="color: red;">PENDING</span> **AND** contains one of `pan` or `pen`

![result for 'findo s/pd m/Panadol'](images/findOrder2Input.png)

### Viewing an order : `viewo` 

Shows the order in the info panel.

Format: `viewo ORDER_NUMBER`

Examples: `viewo 123`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Unlike `viewp`, `viewo` expects an `Order Number` instead of an `Index` </div>


### Updating the status of an order : `updates`

Updates the status of the order to the designated status.

Format: `updates INDEX s/STATUS`

* Statuses: `Pending (pd) -> Preparing (pr) -> Completed (cp) -> Cancelled (cc)`, in increasing hierarchy
* Statuses can only be updated upwards. Once the status of an order progresses to the next stage, it cannot go back.
* Statuses can be updated by skipping the hierarchy. `Pending -> Cancelled`
* Shorthands can be used in replacement of the full names of the statuses

Example: 
* `updates 1 s/completed`
* `updates 1 s/COMPLETED`
* `updates 1 s/cp`
* `updates 1 s/CP`

### Deleting an order : `deleteo` 

Deletes the specified order from PharmHub.

Format: `deleteo INDEX`

Example: `deleteo 2`


---

### Undoing an action : `undo` 

Undoes the last data-modifying action.

Format: `undo`

* Limited to last 30 actions.
* Does not undo Ui views (eg. find, view commands). 

Example: 
* `addp` -> `listp` -> `undo` will undo the `addp` command

### Redoing an undo action : `redo` 

Negates the effect of the last undo.

Format: `redo`

* The undo command must have been the latest data-modifying command.
* Once a non-`undo` data-modifying command is executed, redoing undoes before that non-`undo` command is no longer possible

Example:
* `addp` -> `undo` -> `addp` -> `redo`  will throw an error
* `addp` -> `undo` -> `listp` -> `redo` will redo the `addp` command successfully


### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries (Person, Orders, and Medicines) from PharmHub.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

PharmHub data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

PharmHub data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/pharmhub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PharmHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
