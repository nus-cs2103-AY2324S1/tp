## Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/fulltime` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/fulltime`, `t/student t/year2` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
- The name prefix `n/` allows for **multiple keywords** to be used, separated by spaces.
- The course prefix `c/` and free time prefixes `d/ from/ to/` allows for **one keyword** to be used for each prefix.
- To **search by the free time** field, **all three prefixes** `d/ from/ to/` **must be present** and all respective parameters need to be correctly given.
- The search for names and courses are **case-insensitive** (e.g. `alex` will match `Alex`, `cs1231s` will match `CS1231S`).
- The search for tags is **case-sensitive** (e.g. `parttime` will not match `partTime`).
- **Only full words** will be matched (e.g. `Alex` will not match `Alexis`, `cs1231` will not match `cs1231s`).
- You can apply **multiple search filters** to narrow down the search results by **including multiple filters in one command**.
- The search filters are **applied to the full list of TAs**, not the displayed list of TAs.

</div>

##### Examples:
- `find n/Alex` returns all teaching assistants whose names contain `alex` (e.g. `Alex Yeoh`).
- `find n/Alex Bernice` gives all TAs who have either "Alex" or "Bernice" in their names.
- `find c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants that are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find t/parttime` returns all teaching assistants with the `parttime` tag.
- `find n/Alex c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants whose names contain `alex` and are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants that are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.
- `find c/cs2103t d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants who are teaching `cs2103t` and are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.

### 1.5 Removing a Teaching Assistant: `delete`

You can remove a specified teaching assistant from TAManager, so that you can remove TAs who are no longer part of your teaching team.

##### Format: 
```
delete INDEX
```

| Fields  | Format                          | Remarks                                                                                                                  |
|---------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INDEX` | Positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...) | Index of the teaching assistant in the TA List to be deleted. This index is with reference to the **displayed** TA list. |

##### Examples:
- [`list`](#13-viewing-teaching-assistants-list) followed by `delete 2` deletes the second teaching assistant in the address book.

### 1.6 Updating Hours for Teaching Assistants: `hour`

You can add hours to all teaching assistants in the current list, so that you can efficiently update the total working hours of your teaching assistants.

##### Format: 
```
hour HOUR
```

| Fields | Format  | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HOUR` | Integer | The number of hours to be added to all teaching assistants in the current list. `HOUR` can be **positive** to **increment** the value, or **negative** to **decrement** the value. |

- The resulting total working hour after running the `HOUR` command should still be within the range of 0-9999.
</div>

##### Examples:

- `hour 4` adds 4 hours to all TAs in the TA list.
- `find c/CS1231S` then `hour 4` adds 4 hours to all `CS1231S` TAs and other TAs will not be affected.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in your other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAManager.

**Q**: What is default course?<br>
**A**: The default course is the course that you are currently managing or teaching. It is a useful setting to personalize your TAManager experience. After setting your default course, the list of teaching assistants will be filtered to only show teaching assistants that are teaching the default course on startup.

**Q**: Why can't I add a course to the course list?<br>
**A**: At the moment, TAManager does not support adding course to the course list. However, advanced users can edit the course list directly by editing the `courses.json` file.

**Q**: Why is free time only available from Monday to Friday?<br>
**A**: At the moment, TAManager only supports free time from Monday to Friday. As teaching assistants are usually not working on weekends, we have decided to not include weekends in the free time feature.

**Q**: Why can't I add a teaching assistant with the same name as an existing teaching assistant?<br>
**A**: TAManager does not allow duplicate teaching assistants. This is to prevent confusion when you are managing your teaching assistants.

**Q**: What if I teach multiple courses?<br>
**A**: Instead of the [`teach`](#22-adding-a-default-course--teach) command, you might opt to filter the list of TAs each time using the [`find`](#14-finding-a-teaching-assistant-find) command.

## Glossary 

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
CLI is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer or software application by typing commands into a terminal. CLI relies on text commands to perform tasks.

TAManager is a CLI application where you can type commands to manage your teaching assistants.

Example: When a user types `hour 2` and presses Enter, TAManager will add 2 hours to all TAs in the list.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
GUI is a type of interface that uses visual representations, such as icons, buttons and windows to interact with the system.  

TAManager has a GUI that allows you to view and manage the contact information of your teaching assistants.

Example: When a user types `list` and presses Enter, the application will list all TAs and user can scroll through the list to view the list.

### Javascript Object Notation (JSON)
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. It is also easy for machines to parse and generate.

We have decided to use JSON as the format for TAManager data so that advanced users can easily edit the data file directly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Known Issues
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
**Issue:** When using multiple screens, TAManager does not open on the correct screen.
<br>
<br>
**Solution:** Delete the <code>preferences.json</code> file in the <code>data</code> folder and restart TAManager.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
**Issue:** When the window size is small, longer fields such as names and emails may get cut off.
<br>
<br>
**Solution:** Resize the window to view the full field where possible, or consider shorting the field by using initials or abbreviations.
