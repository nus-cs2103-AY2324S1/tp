UniMate is a desktop app for students to **manage contacts** and **manage schedules** optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, UniMate can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `UniMate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for UniMate.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar UniMate.jar` command to run the application.<br><br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data,
which may differ from that of a fresh download.<br>
   ![Ui](images/unimateScreenshot.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br><br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the AddressBook.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Features Overview

UniMate has 3 core features, [**AddressBook**](#main-feature-1-addressbook), [**Calendar System**](#main-feature-2-calendar-system)
and [**Task Management System**](#main-feature-3-task-management-system). This section serves to
provide you with an overview of what each component entails and the functionalities supporting them.

![uniMateFeatureOverview](images/uniMateFeatures.png)

The screenshot above shows a cropped view of UniMate's GUI. **AddressBook** belongs to the [**AddressBook** feature](#main-feature-1-addressbook),
**CALENDAR** belongs to the [**Calendar System** feature](#main-feature-2-calendar-system) and the **EVENT LIST/TASK LIST**
portion is shared by both the [**Calendar System** feature](#main-feature-2-calendar-system) and [**Task Management System** feature](#main-feature-3-task-management-system).

>To switch between the [Event List](#sub-feature-2-event-list) and [Task List](#main-feature-3-task-management-system),
we have a [CLI-based command](#viewing-tasks-switchlist) for that.

## Main feature 1: AddressBook

The AddressBook serves to ease contact management. 

Some major CLI-based functionalities to support this feature include:
- [**Adding**](#adding-a-person-add), [**deleting**](#deleting-a-person-delete) and [**editing**](#editing-a-person-edit) operations to manipulate contacts in the AddressBook
- [**Finding**](#locating-persons-by-name-find) and [**filtering**](#filtering-persons-by-attribute-filter) operations to search for and isolate contacts of interest
- [**Sorting**](#sort-persons-sort) operation to reorganise the view of the AddressBook when needed 

Other functionalities can be found in the [AddressBook Management subsection found in the Features section](#addressbook-management).

Additionally, each contact in the AddressBook has their own personal calendar, 
which can be accessed simply by double-clicking with the left mouse button on the contact's card in the AddressBook.
This will create a pop-up displaying the contact's calendar as shown below. 

![contactCalendar](images/contactCalendar.png)

**Note:** There is currently no CLI-based command to access this feature, but is planned for a future release.

## Main feature 2: Calendar System
The calendar system seeks to improve the user's schedule planning experience, as well as simplify
the synchronization of schedules among multiple people. 

To achieve this, we have 2 supporting sub-features:
1. [Calendar](#sub-feature-1-calendar)
2. [Event List](#sub-feature-2-event-list)

For the calendar system, we work solely with `events`, which differs from `tasks` used in the [task list feature](#main-feature-3-task-management-system).
- `event` has a `description`, `start date and time` and `end date and time`
- `task` only has a `description` and an **optional** `end date and time`

### Sub-feature 1: Calendar

The calendar allows the user to plan their timetable and compare it against their contacts' schedules. 
This will facilitate scheduling of meetings and events involving the user and their contacts.

>By default, the calendar's GUI will only display the time period of <mark>8am to 6pm</mark>, but will automatically
extend when events that cannot be fit within this time period are added.
> 
>Additionally, the GUI for this sub-feature currently only supports viewing of events <mark>within the current week</mark>.
Upcoming updates will allow the user to navigate beyond this chronological restriction. In the meantime, users can
consider using the [Event List](#sub-feature-2-event-list) to view events outside the current week.

For the **user**'s calendar, some major CLI-based functionalities supporting this sub-feature includes:
- [Adding](#user-calendar-adding-an-event-addevent), [deleting](#user-calendar-deleting-an-event-deleteevent) and [clearing](#user-calendar-deleting-multiple-events-clearevents) operations to manipulate the events in the user's calendar

For the **contact**'s calendar, some major CLI-based functionalities supporting this sub-feature includes:
- [Adding](#contact-calendar-adding-an-event-to-a-contact-addcontactevent), [deleting](#contact-calendar-deleting-an-event-from-a-contact-deletecontactevent) and [editing](#contact-calendar-edit-contact-calendar-event-editcontactevent) operations to manipulate the events in the contact's calendar

Other useful CLI-based functionalities not exclusive to the user/contact supporting this sub-feature includes:
- Comparison operations to compare the user's calendar with their contacts' calendars either by [index](#1-comparison-by-index) or [tag](#2-comparison-by-tag)

Other functionalities can be found in the [Calendar System subsection of the Features section](#calendar-system)

### Sub-feature 2: Event List

The event list displays all the events for the user/contact. It serves as an overview of the collective
events that the user or their contact have.

The event list shown on the main UniMate GUI is the user's event list. To view a specific contact's
event list, we have a [CLI-based command](#viewing-contact-event-list-viewcontactevents) that will
display the contact's event list in a popup window.

## Main-feature 3: Task Management System

The task list stores a collection of tasks that the user might have. The primary difference
between event and task is that a task does not have a starting date and time.

Some useful CLI-based functionalities supporting this feature includes:
- [Adding](#adding-tasks-addtask) and [deleting](#deleting-tasks-deletetask) operations to manipulate the tasks present in the task list
- [Sorting](#sorting-tasks-sorttasks) operation to reorganise the view of the task list when needed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Note that if the parameters are too lengthy, they may be truncated in the UI.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

## General Commands
### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

Alternatively, the message can also be accessed by using the keyboard shortcut `F1` or
through the menu bar (`Help` > `Help`).

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

Alternatively, the user can also exit the application through the menu bar (`File` > `Exit`)

## AddressBook Management

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the AddressBook.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

> **Note:** Currently UniMate does not support the use of forward-slash in the name of contacts (e.g. s/o). The developers
 understand this, and we hope to add support for accepting forward-slashes in the contact's name in a future release.

![addCommand](images/addCommand.png)

In the example, after executing
`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`, we see `John Doe`'s
contact information stored in the AddressBook as the 7th contact on the left-hand side of the GUI.

### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the AddressBook.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list
* The index must be a **positive integer** (i.e. 1, 2, 3, …​)

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the AddressBook
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command

![deleteCommand](images/deleteCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `list`, followed by `delete 7`, `John Doe`, the person with index 7
is removed from the displayed AddressBook.

### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the AddressBook.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided
* Existing values will be updated to the input values
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

![editCommand](images/editCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `edit 1 p/12345678`, `Alex Yeoh` the person with index 1 has his
phone number edited to `12345678`.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain **any** of the given keywords. 

> **Tip:** Multiple arguments passed into the `find` command will be delimited by whitespaces, which means
the arguments `John Doe` will be parsed into 2 separate arguments `John` and `Doe`. To circumvent
this delimitation, consider the [filter command](#filtering-persons-by-attribute-filter).

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search)
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Filtering persons by attribute: `filter`

Filters out persons whose fields contain any of the given keywords. The keywords contained in each field will be treated as a single argument.

Format: `filter [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Filter is case-insensitive. e.g. `cs2103` will match `CS2103`
* The order of the fields does not matter
* All provided fields are searched
* All tags containing the words or part-thereof will be matched (e.g. `Ba` will return `Badminton` or `Basketball` or `Football` or `Backgammon`)
* Only persons matching all specified fields will be returned (i.e. logical `AND` search)
* Arguments in a specific field are not delimited (i.e. the argument `John Doe` in `filter n/John Doe` will be treated as a single argument)
* Indicating a field but leaving it blank e.g. `filter n/` will show all contacts.

Examples:
* `filter t/CS2103` - Displays all contacts with the CS2103 tag or tags containing ``CS2103`` e.g. CS2103T
* `filter t/MA2116 t/CS1010S n/John e/@u.nus.edu` - Displays all contacts with the ``MA2116`` and ``CS1010S`` tags as well as
with a name containing ``John`` and an email address with the domain ``u.nus.edu``

![filterCommand](images/filterCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `filter t/colleagues`, the AddressBook list displays all contacts
that have the `colleagues` tag.

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the AddressBook. This command is particularly useful to
display all the contacts after using the [find](#locating-persons-by-name-find) and [filter](#filtering-persons-by-attribute-filter) commands.

Format: `list`

![listCommand](images/listCommand.png)

In this example, after executing the `list` command, we see the entire AddressBook again.

### Sort persons: `sort`

Format: `sort /COMPARATOR [/reverse]`

* Sorts all persons by specified `COMPARATOR`
* Currently supported `COMPARATOR` include:
    - `byname`
    - `byemail`
    - `byphone`
    - `byaddress`
* The comparator refers to the attribute(s) provided for the basis to sort
* Only sorting by one attribute is allowed, due to the nature of most fields being unique (with the unlikely cases of name and address)
* The sorting is done according to [ASCII](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.1?topic=sequences-us-english-ascii-code-page) sequence, but is case-insensitive (i.e. `adam` has precedence over `Beatrice` when sorted in ascending order)
* Sorting is done in ascending order by default. To sort by descending order, the field `/reverse` can be added to the command (see Examples below)

Examples:
* `sort /byname` sorts all contacts in UniMate AddressBook by their full name
* `sort /byaddress /reverse` sorts all contacts in UniMate AddressBook by their address

![sortCommand](images/sortCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `sort /byphone`, the AddressBook is now sorted according to the
contact's phone numbers, in ascending numerical order.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the AddressBook.

Format: `clear`

![clearCommand](images/clearCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `clear`, the AddressBook is now cleared of all contacts.

## Calendar System

### General Definitions

> **Date Time Format**
>* When inputting a date and time into a command, the following format is used:
>
>  `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` where
>      * `yyyy` represents the year,
>      * `MM` represents the month,
>      * `dd` represents the day,
>      * `HH` represents the hours and
>      * `mm` represents the minutes.
>
>**Event span**
>*  The chronological span of the event is **inclusive** of the start date and time, but **exclusive** of the end date and time.
  This means that for 2 consecutive events, the later event can start at the same time the earlier event ends.

### \[USER CALENDAR\] Adding an event: `addEvent`

Adds an event to the user's calendar.

Format: `addEvent d/DESCRIPTION ts/START_DATE_TIME te/END_DATE_TIME`

* Adds the event starting from `START_DATE_TIME` and ending at `END_DATE_TIME`
* `DESCRIPTION` must be non-empty
* `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` must be in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format
* `START_DATE_TIME` must be before `END_DATE_TIME` for the command to be valid

Example:
* `addEvent d/Cry about deadlines ts/2023-01-01 13:00 te/2023-01-01 15:00`

![addEventCommand](images/addEventCommand.png)

In this example, after executing the command `addEvent d/myEvent ts/2023-11-08 14:00 te/2023-11-08 16:00`,
the event `myEvent` is now visible in both the calendar on the right and the event list at the bottom, as
the date of `myEvent` coincides with the current week when the screenshot was taken.

In the case `myEvent` happens before/after the current week, it will not be displayed in the calendar, but will still
show in the event list.

### \[USER CALENDAR\] Deleting an event: `deleteEvent`

Deletes an event from the user's calendar.

Format `deleteEvent DATE_TIME_DURING_EVENT`

* Deletes an event at the specified date and time.
* An event is considered to be at that date and time if the date time lies between the start time (inclusive) and the
end time (exclusive).
* If there is no event during `DATE_TIME_DURING_EVENT`, an error will be thrown.

Example:
`deleteEvent 2023-11-01 12:00`

![deleteEventCommand](images/deleteEventCommand.png)

In this example, after executing the command `deleteEvent 2023-11-08 15:00`, `myEvent`(added in 
the [addEvent command example](#user-calendar-adding-an-event-addevent)) that is happening during the
specified time was deleted, leaving an empty calendar and event list.

### \[USER CALENDAR\] Deleting multiple events: `clearEvents`

Clears all events within a specified time range.

> **Note:** In order to ensure the user does not make the mistake of deleting more events than intended,
this command requires additional **confirmation** (refer to command format below) from the user to fully execute. 
Without the confirmation, the result box will instead display the list of events that will be deleted if the
command were to fully execute, for the user's verification.

Format: `clearEvents ts/START_DATE_TIME te/END_DATE_TIME c/CONFIRMATION`

* Deletes all events from the specified start date and time to the specified end date and time
* An event is considered to be within the time range if overlaps with the time range for any period of time, inclusive of `START_DATE_TIME` but exclusive of `END_DATE_TIME`
* When the `CONFIRMATION` is absent, the command shows all events within the time range but does not delete them. The
same command is then shown with the confirmation included that can be copied and pasted to execute the command
* The `START_DATE_TIME` must be before `END_DATE_TIME`
* If there is no `START_DATE_TIME` or `END_DATE_TIME`, an error will be thrown

Example:
`clearEvents ts/2023-01-01 00:00 te/2023-12-31 23:59 c/CONFIRMED`

![clearEventsCommand](images/clearEventsCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `clearEvents ts/2023-11-08 14:00 te/2023-11-08 16:00 c/CONFIRMED`, `myEvent`(added in
the [addEvent command example](#user-calendar-adding-an-event-addevent)) that is happening during the duration of the
specified time was deleted, leaving an empty calendar and event list. 

### Event List/Task List switch: `switchList`

Events can be viewed from the calendar GUI that appears on the right.

Additionally, a list of all events are displayed by default at the bottom. This list at the bottom can be switched to a
task list with the `switchList` command. More information can be found under at [Viewing all Tasks](#task-management-system).

### \[CONTACT CALENDAR\] Adding an event to a contact: `addContactEvent`

Adds an event to a contact's calendar at the specified index.

Format: `addContactEvent INDEX d/DESCRIPTION ts/START_DATE_TIME ts/END_DATE_TIME`

* Adds the event starting from `START_DATE_TIME` and ending at `END_DATE_TIME`
* `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` must be in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format
* `START_DATE_TIME` must be before `END_DATE_TIME` for the command to be valid

Example:
* `addContactEvent 1 d/Team Meeting ts/2024-01-01 09:00 te/2024-01-01 11:00`

![addContactEventCommand](images/addContactEventCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `addContactEvent 1 d/Alex's Event ts/2023-11-08 14:00 te/2023-11-08 18:00` and 
[double-clicking on the person card](#main-feature-1-addressbook) of index 1 in the AddressBook, the
contact's calendar pops up, revealing `Alex's Event`. In the case that the event happens before/after
the current week, it will not be shown in the calendar, but will still be displayed in the 
[contact's event list](#viewing-contact-event-list-viewcontactevents).

### \[CONTACT CALENDAR\] Deleting an event from a contact: `deleteContactEvent`

Deletes an event from a contact's calendar at the specified index.

Format `deleteContactEvent INDEX ts/DATE_TIME`

* Deletes an event that contains the `DATE_TIME` from the contact

Example:
* `deleteContactEvent 1 ts/2024-01-01 09:00`

![deleteContactEvent](images/deleteContactEventCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `deleteContactEvent 1 ts/2023-11-08 14:00` and
[double-clicking on the person card](#main-feature-1-addressbook) of index 1 in the AddressBook,
the contact's calendar pops up, revealing an empty calendar as `Alex's Event` (added in the 
[example in addContactEvent](#contact-calendar-adding-an-event-to-a-contact-addcontactevent)),
occurring at the specified time, has been removed.

### \[CONTACT CALENDAR\] Edit Contact Calendar Event: `editContactEvent`

Edits the details of an event in a contact's calendar. 

> **Note:** If this command is executed while the event list of the contact of interest is open, 
the event list will not be updated until the tab is closed and open again.

Format: `editContactEvent PERSON_INDEX EVENT_INDEX [d/DESCRIPTION] [ts/NEW_START_DATE_TIME][te/NEW_END_DATE_TIME]`

* Edits `EVENT_INDEX` event of the `PERSON_INDEX` person in the AddressBook with the given fields.

Example: `editContactEvent 1 1 d/Nap`, `editContactEvent 2 3 ts/2023-10-10 10:00 te/2023-10-12 15:00`

* Note that all edited fields are optional, but there must be at least 1 edited field.

![editContactEventBefore](images/editContactEventCommandBefore.png)

In this example, we see this is the state of the calendar of `Alex Yeoh`, the person with index 1
in the AddressBook.

![editContactEventMessage](images/editContactEventCommandMessage.png)

After executing `editContactEvent 1 1 d/Edited Description`, we get this confirmation message

![editContactEventAfter](images/editContactEventCommandAfter.png)

We can see that the event `Nap` has its description changed to `Edited Description`.

### Viewing contact event list: `viewContactEvents`

Creates a pop-up that displays a list of all events of a calendar belonging to a person in the AddressBook.

Format: `viewContactEvents INDEX`

* Views the event list of the person at `INDEX` as displayed.

Example:
* `viewContactEvents 1`

![viewContactEvents](images/viewContactEventsCommand.png)

In this example, after execute `viewContactEvents 1`, a pop-up with the list of events of the person
with index 1 in the AddressBook, which in this case is `Alex Yeoh` shows up.

### Comparing calendars with AddressBook Contacts
There are 2 ways for the user to compare calendars with their AddressBook contacts:
- [Index](#1-comparison-by-index)
- [Tag](#2-comparison-by-tag)

The resulting pop-up calendar will display the time periods where all parties
are not available as greyed out sections. The pop-up has to be closed in order for the user to access
the main application again.

>**Note:** Arguments for the commands are <mark>optional</mark>, hence `compareCalendars` and
`compareGroupCalendars` are valid commands, but the resulting pop-up will just display the
user's calendar.

#### 1. Comparison by index

Format `compareCalendars [INDEX]...`

* Compare calendar with the contacts at the respective `INDEX`
* `INDEX` must be a positive non-zero integer that is smaller or equals to the size of the AddressBook
* If the `INDEX` number provided is invalid, an error will be returned
* If no `INDEX` is supplied, the resulting pop-up will just display the user's calendar

Example:
`compareCalendars 1 3 5`

![compareCalendars](images/compareCalendarsCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `compareCalendars 1`, we see the timings when both the user and
the person with index 1 (`Alex Yeoh`) are not free is blocked out.

#### 2. Comparison by tag

Format `compareGroupCalendars [TAG]...`

* Compare calendar with the contacts with the specified `TAG`
* If some of the `TAG` provided are invalid, the resulting pop-up will ignore the invalid `TAG`
* If all the `TAG` provided are invalid, the resulting pop-up will just display the user's calendar
* If no `TAG` is supplied, the resulting pop-up will just display the user's calendar

Example:
`compareGroupCalendars school friends`

![compareGroupCalendars](images/compareGroupCalendarsCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `compareGroupCalendars friends`, we see the timings when both the
user and the contacts that have the `friends` tag are unavailable are blocked out.

### Import *.ics files (Coming Soon)

User can import *.ics files, which will automatically be integrated into
their UniMate calendars.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

### View other weeks of Calendar (Coming Soon)

User can view other weeks of their calendar schedule beyond just the
current week.

Format: `viewWeek DATE`

## Task Management System

Tasks consist of a `DESCRIPTION` and an **optional** `DEADLINE`.

> **Note:** Tasks can have the same `DESCRIPTION` or `DEADLINE`, but not both. 

### Viewing tasks: `switchList`

Switches the bottom list between the event list and the task list.

Format: `switchList`

* All input after `switchList` will be ignored.
* The bottom list displays the event list by default.

![switchList](images/switchListCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `switchList`, we see that the bottom of the GUI has switched from 
[`event list`](#sub-feature-2-event-list) to the [`task list`](#main-feature-3-task-management-system).

### Adding tasks: `addTask`

Adds a task to the Task Manager.

Format: `addTask d/DESCRIPTION [te/DEADLINE]`

* `DESCRIPTION` cannot be empty.
* `DEADLINE` must be in the same format given [above](#general-definitions) for date and time.
* `DEADLINE` can also be omitted to create a task with no specified deadline.
* When adding a task with a deadline with a date that is invalid but with a day of 31 or less, instead adds a task with 
a deadline on the last day of the month.
* While there is no character limit for Task descriptions, descriptions will be truncated if they are too long to 
display.

Examples: 
* `addTask d/Go for a run te/2023-02-14 19:00`
* `addTask d/Hydrate regularly!`
* `addTask d/Fix CS2103 Project bug te/2023-02-31 12:00` creates the task with deadline `2023-02-28 12:00` instead.

![addTask](images/addTaskCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `addTask d/Hydrate regularly!`, we see the new `Hydrate regularly!`
task appearing at the bottom of the task list.

### Deleting tasks: `deleteTask`

Deletes a task from the Task Manager according to the index of the task displayed in the task list.

Format: `deleteTask INDEX`
        
* Throws an error if there is no `INDEX` present or if it exceeds the length of the task list.

Examples:
* `deleteTask 1`

![deleteTask](images/deleteTaskCommand.png)

In this example, after executing `deleteTask 4`, the `Hydrate regularly!` task added in the 
[previous example](#adding-tasks-addtask) was removed.

### Sorting tasks: `sortTasks`

Changes the way tasks in the Task Manager are displayed in the task list.

Format: `sortTasks PARAMETER`

* `PARAMETER` can only be `DESCRIPTION` or `DEADLINE`.

Examples:
* `sortTasks DESCRIPTION` sorts tasks by their `DESCRIPTION` alphabetically.
* `sortTasks DEADLINE` sorts tasks by their `DEADLINE`. Tasks with deadlines are prioritised above tasks with no 
deadline.

In this example, after executing `sortTasks DESCRIPTION`, the tasks are now sorted in ascending
alphanumeric order.

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous UniMate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. If the zoom setting of the operating system is not set to 100%, it might cause inconsistencies in the UI which may cause the event cards displayed in the [**Calendar GUI**](#features-overview) to be lined up incorrectly.
