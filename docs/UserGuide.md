## Known Issues

TutorConnect is always looking to improve. Currently, there are a few known issues within the app that our 
development team is working round the clock to solve. Don't worry, every version of TutorConnect released for you to 
use is sure to solve your scheduling needs.

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only 
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by 
   the application before running the application again.
2. **When running Java versions older than `Java 11`**, users may encounter an error after double clicking to launch 
   the application. The solution is to launch the application with a command terminal as described in `Warning
   for unable to open jar file` in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.

**<sup id="note1">1</sup> `KEYWORD` Search Format and Behaviour**

Commands reference: [find-t](#locating-tutors-by-name-find-t), [find-s](#locating-schedules-by-name-find-s)
* The `KEYWORD` search has no restriction on characters entered e.g. `h@ns` is a valid input, but will only return entries matching to `h@ns`.
* The `KEYWORD` search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match for `Hans` too!
* The order of the `KEYWORD` does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Tutors matching at least one `KEYWORD` will be matched. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match both `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.
* The `KEYWORD` entered will match ANY part of the tutor's name, while `KEYWORD` that do not match a tutor's name are ignored. e.g. `Hans Bl@bl@$lah` will match `Hans Gruber` and `Hans Yang`.

**<sup id="note2">2</sup> Email Format**

Commands reference: [add-t](#adding-a-tutor-add-t), [edit-t](#editing-a-tutor-edit-t)
1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.

The domain name must:
* end with a domain label at least 2 characters long.
* have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters.
* have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.


**<sup id="note3">3</sup> `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm` Format**

Commands reference: [add-s](#adding-a-schedule-add-s), [edit-s](#editing-a-schedule-edit-s)
* `yyyy` represents the **year** (e.g., 2023).
* `MM` represents the **month** with a leading zero (e.g., 09 for September, 10 for October).
* `dd` represents the **day** of the month with a leading zero (e.g., 03, 15).
* `T` is a **separator** indicating the start of the time portion.
* `HH` represents the **hour** in **24-hour format** with a leading zero (e.g., 09 for 9 AM, 21 for 9 PM).
* `mm` represents the **minutes** with a leading zero (e.g., 05).
