# ProfBook User Guide :bulb:

Welcome to ProfBook, a specialised **student management system** exclusively tailored for **CS2103T tutors** by CS2103T 
students.  This guide is your gateway to unlocking the potential of ProfBook, where you will discover how ProfBook can 
help streamline your administrative tasks, alleviate workload and most importantly reduce any administrative errors.

## What can ProfBook do :raising_hand:
As current students of CS2103T, we understand that CS2103T tutors have a high administrative workload on top of their 
existing tutor duties. On top of that, any administrative mistakes or oversights can increase that workload 
exponentially and may adversely impact students' learning. We deeply appreciate your role, and it is precisely to 
address these aforementioned issues that we designed ProfBook. ProfBook aims to
**drastically decrease administrative mistakes and your workload**.

ProfBook is optimized for tutors' use via a **familiar Command Line Interface (CLI) that uses Linux-styled commands** 
while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a fast typer, ProfBook will empower you 
to efficiently track and manage students' progress and tasks, surpassing the capabilities of traditional GUI apps 
with a gentle learning curve.

## Features overview

### Consolidated Information

As a project-based module, CS2103T tutors have to juggle multiple groups. ProfBook
aims to expedite this process by allowing you to keep track of all your groups and their progress within a centralised 
location. You would be able to traverse between the different groups quickly through familiar Linux commands.

### Student and Group Management 

ProfBook aids with the **management of student and group information**. ProfBook efficiently encapsulates information of 
every project group so that you can easily monitor their progress and relevant information.  You can 
effortlessly **add, delete and edit students or groups** and even **move students from one group to another**.

### Task Management

In addition to the efficient management of student and group information, ProfBook also aids with the 
**management of task information**.  You can quickly and seamlessly **allocate tasks to specific student or group** 
and track their progress. With ProfBook, you can easily monitor each stage of the task journey, 
from start to finish, ensuring optimal productivity.

## Understanding ProfBook :books:

### ProfBook Folder Structure

ProfBook is organized hierarchically with the following structure:

  <tree>
  ~/
    grp-001/
      1001Z
      4123U
    grp-002/
      5815Y
    grp-003/
      ...
  </tree>

  **Root Directory (e.g., `~/`)**<br>
  The Root Directory serves as the main container for the ProfBook software. This is where all the data is organized.

  **Group Directories (e.g., `grp-001`, `grp-002`, ...)**<br>
  Within the Root Directory, there are Group Directories only. Each Group Directory is dedicated to managing a specific group of students.

**Student Directories (e.g., `1001Z`, `5815Y`, ...)**<br>
  Inside each Group Directory, you'll find Student Directories only. These directories represent individual students 
within each group.

  This hierarchical structure enables a well-organized and efficient way to manage groups and students within ProfBook.

### ProfBook Command Format

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the **compulsory** parameters to be supplied by you.
  * e.g. In `touch SPECIFIED_PATH -n NAME`, `SPECIFIED_PATH` and the other field in `UPPER_CASE` can be substituted 
  with the desired details to form `touch 2000Y --name Bob`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` that are surrounded by `[square brackets]` are **optional** parameters to be supplied by you.
  * e.g. In `cat [SPECIFIED_PATH]`, `[SPECIFIED_PATH]` can be substituted with details or left empty, 
      `cat 2000Y` and `cat` are acceptable commands.
- Parameters can be in any order.
  * e.g. If the command specifies `-n NAME -e EMAIL`, `-e EMAIL -n NAME` is also acceptable.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. 
  * e.g. If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Regarding the detection of duplicates,
  - **For students and groups**, duplicates can only be detected if they share the same StudentId or GroupId respectively
  across ProfBook. 
  - **For Todo tasks**, duplicates can only be detected if the todo tasks share the same
      description (`DESCRIPTION`).
  - **For Deadline tasks**, duplicates can only be detected if the deadline tasks share the same 
  description (`DESCRIPTION`) and due date (`DATE_AND_TIME`).
* If you would like to pass in a field that starts with `\`, `-` or `--`, you would need to use `\` before the start of
that field. 
  * Else, fields that start with `-` or `--` will be treated as [flags](#flags) and fields that start with `\`
  will be treated without `\`(`\Orchard` when inputted will be treated as `Orchard`).
    * e.g. To pass in `-Clementi` in the `edit` command, the command would be `edit -a \-Clementi`.

<box type="warning">

If you are using a PDF version of this document, please be careful when copying and pasting commands that span 
multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
 </box>

### Flags :triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post::triangular_flag_on_post:
All flags begin with `--` or `-`.
Flags usually **come before** essential details required by the command and are compatible in both long and short forms:

- `--name` / `-n` followed by the name of student or group as specified by command.
* `--email` / `-e` followed by the email of student. 
- `--phone` / `-p` followed by the phone number of student.
* `--address` / `-a` followed by the address of student.
- `--id` / `-i` followed by a `STUDENT_ID` or `GROUP_ID` as specified by the command.
* `--desc` / `-d` followed by the description of task specified by command.
- `--datetime` / `-dt` followed by the due date of a deadline task in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format.
* `--all` / `-al` followed by either: 
  - `allStu` which adds **individual** tasks to all students within the specified directory.
    - Can only be used at a group or root directory.  
      - If used at **group directory**, task will be added to **all students in that group**.
      - If used at **root directory**, task will be added to **all students in ProfBook**.
  - `allGrp` which adds **group** tasks to all groups within the root directory.
    - Can only be used at root directory.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- `--help` / `-h`
  - Use with any command (except `exit`, `help` and `clear`) for more information.
  - e.g. `touch --help` to learn more about how to add a student to ProfBook.

### Acceptable values for each parameter

`SPECIFIED_PATH`:
- Must be a **valid** path. 
- Most commands will require the `SPECIFIED_PATH` to be a present path (path that currently exists within ProfBook)
except for the [`touch`](#add-a-student-touch) and [`mkdir`](#create-a-group-mkdir) commands.

| **Symbol** | **Purpose of symbol**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `..`       | Step up one level from the current directory. <br> e.g. when executing [`cd ..`](#change-directory-cd) at the group directory, you will move up to the root directory.                                |
| `.`        | Stays as current directory.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `/`        | Between every type of directory (Root, Group and Student), it will be separated by `/`. <br> This format ensures a clear and consistent representation, which aligns with the familiar Linux command. |
|`~`| Represents the root directory.                                                                                                                                                                        | 

<box type="info">

To begin writing a **valid** path, start with the directory you can and intend to navigate. Alternatively, you can always 
commence from the root directory, `~/`, and define your path as the route leading from the root directory to your desired directory.

Kindly note that **direct navigation between directories of the same type is not permitted**. 
You would need to navigate up by at least one directory before moving to the desired directory. <br>
e.g. use `../grp-001` to navigate up to the root directory first before navigating to the `grp-001` group directory 
from another group directory. 

Additionally, **skipping directories between other directories is not allowed**. For instance, to navigate from the root directory
to a student directory, `0123Y`, where the student directory is within group directory, `grp-001`,
you would need to utilize `~/grp-001/0123Y` and **not** `~/0123Y`.
 </box>

`NAME`:
- Must be a non-empty string that only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
- This means that you cannot input a blank field. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

`EMAIL`:
- Must be a non-empty string following the format of `local-part@domain`.
  - `local-part`:
    - Should only contain alphanumeric characters and special characters, 
    `+` `_` `.` `-`.
    - May not start or end with any special characters.
  - `domain`:
    -  Made up of **domain labels** separated by periods.
      - **Domain labels**:
        - At least 2 characters long.
        - Consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
        - Must end with alphanumeric characters.

`PHONE_NUMBER`:
- Must be a non-empty string of numbers of at least 3 digits. 

`ADDRESS`:
- Must be a non-empty string, which means you cannot input a blank field.

`STUDENT_ID`:
- Must follow the format of a valid StudentId.

<box type="info">

**Required format for StudentId:**
- `XXXXa` where `XXXX` is replaceable with any 4-digit whole number and `a` is replaceable with any alphabet.
  - **Note:** StudentId here corresponds to the last 5 place of an NUS student's matriculation number and is not
    a StudentId created by you. This format helps you to identify students easily while maintaining
    privacy and security.
  * eg. `8467U`
</box>
  
`GROUP_ID`:
- Must follow the format of a valid GroupId.

<box type="info">

**Required format for GroupId:**
- `grp-XXX` where `XXX` is replaceable with any 3-digit whole number.
  - **Note:** GroupId is case-insensitive, meaning `GrP-001` and `Grp-002` are also acceptable.
  * eg. `grp-001`
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

`DESCRIPTION`:
- Must be a non-empty string, which means you cannot input a blank field.

Following the execution of the `touch` command, Bob appears in the Student List. The **Message Display Column**
also indicates the addition of a new student, Bob. <br>
Observe that all fields for Bob, except for Name and StudentId, are marked `n/a` as you did 
not include them in the initial command. But fear not! You can always add these additional fields through
the [edit command](#edit-a-student-edit)!
</box>

<box type="tip">

When you are at the group directory `~/grp-001` and would like to add the same student, to another directory 
`~/grp-002` instead, 
- You could use `touch ../grp-002/0200Y --name Bob` to save yourself the trouble from having to change 
  directory before executing the `touch` command!

## Tasks command :clipboard:

<box type = "info">

**Student Tasks** are tasks assigned to **individual students**. These tasks are ideal for
assignments where each student is required to complete and submit their assignment independently. 

**Group Tasks** on the other hand are tasks designated for a **specific group as a collective responsibility**, not individual
students within the group. They are suitable for tasks that require group collaboration instead of individual
student contributions.
</box>

<box type="warning">

Tasks are **only allocated to groups or students**. 
This means that tasks **cannot be allocated to the root directory**.
</box>

`~/grp-001` to allocate the task to just this student,
    - `todo 0001Y --desc Redo tutorial`

<box type="tip">

When you have an assignment, `Assignment 1` to be allocated to **all your students** in `grp-001`, you could use the 
following command at the root directory, `~/`,  
- `todo ~/grp-001 --desc Assignment 1 --all allStu`

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <span style="color: #FF8C00;">Create Deadline Task : `deadline` </span>

</box>

<box type="warning">

When using this command, you will first need to [`cat`](#display-all-tasks-cat) at the path where the task list is at before executing `mark`.
</box>

#### Example(s):

- When you find yourself in the `~/grp-001` directory and wish to mark the completion of the first task 
allocated to student with the StudentId `0123Y`, you could follow these commands in sequential order.
  1. `cat 0123Y`
  1. `mark 1`

<box type="info">

![Ui](images/markcommand.png){width=2838 height=1186}

</box>

<box type="warning">

When using this command, you will first need to [`cat`](#display-all-tasks-cat) at the path where the task list is at before executing `unmark`.
</box>

#### Example(s):
- When you are at the `~/grp-001` directory and would like to unmark the first task
  allocated to this group, you could follow these commands in sequential order.
  1. `cat`
  1. `unmark 1`

<box type="info">

The process and result shown should be similar to the `mark` command except that 
instead of noticing the presence of a tick in the **Task Status Box**,
you should observe an **absence of the tick** after executing the `unmark` command.
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

is at before executing `rmt`.
</box>

#### Example(s):
- When you are at the `~/grp-001` directory and no longer want to keep track of the first task 
allocated to student with the StudentId `0123Y`, you could always remove this task by following these 
commands in sequential order.
  1. `cat 0123Y`
  2. `rmt 1`

## Commonly made mistakes

<box type="warning">

As Albert Einstein wisely said, "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new".
</box>

At ProfBook, we wholeheartedly believe that mistakes are part of the learning journey. We are here to support
you in your quest of mastering ProfBook, helping you recover from any hiccups that may happen along the way. 
As such, we have collated a list of some commonly made mistakes and solutions to them. :muscle:

##### Mistake 1: Invalid command format
Some possible errors from invalid command format are,
1. **Excessive or duplicate arguments.**
   - This occurs when there are duplicate flags or an excess of compulsory or optional parameters as outlined in the command format.
2. **Missing arguments.**
   - This issue arises when there are missing compulsory parameters from the command you entered. 
3. **Invalid option.**
   - **Solution:**
     - Pay close attention to the **invalid option (also known as flags)** indicated in the return message. 
     - First, ensure that the **option is applicable** for the command you are utilising. 
     - Second, confirm that there are **no misspellings** especially when it comes to options in their long forms.
       By adhering to these steps, you could efficiently correct invalid options in your commands.
  
<box type = "info">

Please note that if there are multiple invalid options, only the first invalid option will be shown in the return
message. <br> 
This approach aids you to concentrate on addressing the current invalid option before moving on to the subsequent
ones. The next invalid option will be shown after rerunning the command if the current invalid option has been solved.
</box>

**General solution:**
Ensure that the command you enter adheres to the format provided in the user guide.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Mistake 2: Invalid path
**Solution:**
Please check that the path you entered is the path required by the command which can be seen in the User
Guide.
Additionally, do ensure that it is the intended path you wish to utilise, and it exists within ProfBook.

##### Mistake 3: Invalid task index
**Solution:**
Task index starts from 1. Check that the index you input is a positive whole number and falls within the range 
of 1 to the total number of tasks in the task list.

##### Mistake 4: The display panel is not showing task list
**Solution:**
Please do not forget to execute the [`cat`](#display-all-tasks-cat) command prior to executing the required command.

##### Mistake 5: At least one field to edit must be provided
**Solution:**
If **editing a student**, ensure that you have indicated at least one field 
(`NAME`, `EMAIL`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `ADDRESS` or `STUDENT_ID`) to edit and that the flag used is accurate. <br>
If **editing a group**, ensure that you have indicated at least one field (`NAME` or `GROUP_ID`)
to edit and that the flag used is accurate.

##### Mistake 6: Value(s) provided is the same as the current value(s). No changes have been made.
**Solution:**
When modifying information for a student or group, please ensure that **at least one field** you intend 
to edit **differs from the current parameters** associated with the student or group.

##### Mistake 7: Duplicate Id.
**Solution:**
Ensure that the GroupId or StudentId you entered does not coincide 
with other GroupId or StudentId respectively in the whole ProfBook.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install ProfBook in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous ProfBook home folder.

**Q**: Is there an `edit` command for tasks?<br>
**A**: Currently, we do not have an `edit` command for tasks. But we would love to have it in ProfBook and 
are definitely working toward including it in our future enhancements. 

---

## Known issues

<box type="warning">

Do note that if you decide to edit the data file manually, any invalid edits may cause the presence
of duplicates or cause ProfBook to start with an empty file. So, do proceed with caution!
</box>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.

---
## Exciting future developments :eyes:

This section is dedicated to the exciting future enhancements we envision for ProfBook. 

**Viewing edited group name at current group directory:**
  - **Current:** To view changes to the group name, you would need to `cd` out of the current group directory to 
  the root directory, similar to terminal behaviour. 
  - **Upcoming enhancement:** ProfBook will return a more informative message that clearly indicates the updated 
group name after execution of command.

**Marking and Unmarking tasks:**
  - **Current:** You can mark and unmark tasks that are already marked or unmarked respectively.
  - **Upcoming enhancement:** ProfBook will return a return message confirming that the task has already been marked 
or unmarked, and the current command will not result in any changes.

**Editing tasks:**
- **Current:** ProfBook does not have an `edit` command for tasks. But you could always `rmt` the task
and add it back through the `todo` or `deadline` command!
- **Upcoming enhancement:** We are actively developing the `edit` command for tasks, mirroring the
`edit` command for students and groups. This addition will simplify the learning process of this new command,
ensuring a seamless experience for you.
