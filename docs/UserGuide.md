# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Every word in uppercase represents a field you can supply.<br>
  e.g. in `addc n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter that can be substituted for `John Doe`, as in `addc n/John Doe`.

- Fields contained in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. when provided with the fields `n/NAME [t/TAG]`, you can submit `n/John Doe t/friend` if you want to mark this contact as a `friend`, or `n/John Doe` otherwise.

- Fields with `…`​ after them can be submitted any number of times, including zero.<br>
  e.g. when provided with the field `[t/TAG]…​`, you can leave the field blank, or submit `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, etc.

- You can submit fields in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, submitting in the format `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`, such as in `p/91472381 n/John Doe`, is also acceptable.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. This is to avoid deletion of space characters surrounding line-breaks when lengthy text is copied over to the application.

### Adding a contact: `addc`

Adds a contact to OutBook.

Format: `addc n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL [lc/LAST_CONTACTED_TIME] [s/STATUS] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

- Duplicate contacts are not allowed. Contacts are duplicates if they have the same `NAME`, `PHONE`, or `EMAIL`.
- `NAME`, `PHONE`, and `EMAIL` are compulsory fields.
- `LAST_CONTACTED_TIME`, `STATUS`, `REMARK` and `TAG` are optional fields:
    - If `LAST_CONTACTED_TIME` is not specified, it will be defaulted to the minimum datetime provided by Java (i.e. `LocalDateTime.MIN`) and displayed as `NA` in the contacts list.
    - If `STATUS` is not specified, it will be defaulted to `NIL`.
- This command may change the contact that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewc` command, as detailed [here](#viewing-detailed-contact-information--viewc).


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can put any number of tags (including 0) on a contact.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
- `addc n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`
- `addc n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com p/1234567 lc/01.01.2023 0100 t/Professor`


### Listing all contacts: `listc`

Shows an unfiltered list of all contacts in OutBook in the contacts list. Contacts are sorted by their `LAST_CONTACTED_TIME`.

Format: `listc`

* This command may change the contact that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewc` command, as detailed [here](#viewing-detailed-contact-information--viewc).


### Deleting a contact: `deletec`

Deletes a contact from OutBook.

Format: `deletec CONTACT_INDEX`

- Deletes the contact at the specified `CONTACT_INDEX`.
- This command clears the contact that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewc` command.

Examples:
- `listc` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the unfiltered contacts list returned by [`listc`](#listing-all-contacts--listc).
- `findc Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the filtered contacts list returned by [`findc`](#finding-contacts-findc).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a contact : `editc`

Edits an existing contact in OutBook.

Format: `editc CONTACT_INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [lc/LAST_CONTACTED_TIME] [s/STATUS] [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…​`

- Edits the contact at the specified `CONTACT_INDEX`. 
- All fields are optional, but at least one must be provided.
- Existing values in each specified field will be updated to the corresponding input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the contact will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the contact's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
- This command may change the contact that is currently displayed via the `viewc` command, as detailed [here](#viewing-detailed-contact-information--viewc).

Examples:
- `editc 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st contact to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
- `editc 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd contact to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing detailed contact information : `viewc`

Displays detailed information of a contact in the details list.

Format: `viewc CONTACT_INDEX`

- Displays the `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `LAST_CONTACTED_TIME`, `STATUS`, `REMARK` and `TAG` of the contact at the specified `CONTACT_INDEX`.
- As this command displays the contact at the specified `CONTACT_INDEX` in the contacts list, the contact displayed in the details list may change due to a modification in list order through the use of `addc`, `editc` or `listc` commands. This is intentional.
- The displayed contact is cleared from the details list when the `deletec` and `findc` commands are used.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
- `viewc 3` displays detailed information related to the 3rd contact on the contacts list.
![result for 'viewContact'](images/ViewContactResult.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding contacts: `findc`
Finds contact(s) that match the keywords specified for at least 1 of these fields: `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `LAST_CONTACTED_TIME`, `STATUS`, `TAG`. The contacts list will be filtered to show only the results of this command. 

Format: `findc [n/KEYWORDS] [p/KEYWORDS] [e/KEYWORDS] [lc/DATETIME] [s/KEYWORDS] [t/KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive, e.g `shop` will return `SHOP`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter, e.g. `Shop Meet` will return `Meet Shop`.
* For `NAME`, `STATUS` and `TAG`, only full words will be matched, e.g. `John` will return `John Lee` but not `Johnny`.
* For `EMAIL`, any email addresses that contains the sequence of characters specified in the inputs will be given as a result, e.g.  `_` will return `m_e@gmail.com`.
* For `PHONE`, any phone number that contains the sequence of digits specified in the inputs will be given as a result, e.g. `913` will return `90091300` but not `90103000`.
* For `LAST_CONTACTED_TIME`, the input must adhere to the `DD.MM.YYYY HHMM` format, e.g. 9th October 2023, 10.30am will be written as `09.10.2023 1030`.
* If only one field is provided, all contacts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
* If multiple fields are provided, only contacts matching at least one keyword in each field will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
  - e.g. `n/John s/active` will return `Name: John Lee, Status: Active` but not `Name: John Doe, Status: Claimant`.
* This command clears the contact that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewc` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
- `findc n/Alice` returns all contacts with a name that contains `alice`
- `findc p/51` returns all contacts with a phone number that contains `51`

* This command may change the meeting that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewm` command, as detailed [here](#viewing-detailed-meeting-information--viewm).

Examples:
- `addm m/Lunch a/Cafeteria s/20.09.2023 1200 e/20.09.2023 1300`
- `addm m/CS2103T meeting a/Zoom call url s/20.09.2023 1000 e/20.09.2023 1200`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all meetings : `listm`

Shows an unfiltered list of all meetings in OutBook in the meetings list. Meetings are sorted by their `START` time.

Format: `listm`

* This command may change the meeting that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewm` command, as detailed [here](#viewing-detailed-meeting-information--viewm).

### Deleting a meeting : `deletem`

Deletes a meeting from OutBook.

Format: `deletem MEETING_INDEX`

- Deletes the meeting at the specified `MEETING_INDEX`.
- This command clears the meeting that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewm` command.

Examples:
- `listm` followed by `deletem 2` deletes the 2nd meeting in the unfiltered meetings list returned by [`listm`](#listing-all-meetings--listm).
- `findm m/Project` followed by `deletem 1` deletes the 1st meeting in the filtered meetings list returned by [`findm`](#finding-meetings-findm).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a meeting : `editm`

Edits an existing meeting in OutBook.

Format: `editm MEETING_INDEX [m/TITLE] [a/LOCATION] [s/START] [e/END] [t/TAG]…​`

- Edits the meeting at the specified `MEETING_INDEX`.
- All fields are optional, but at least one must be provided.
- Existing values in each specified field will be updated to the corresponding input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the meeting will be removed, i.e. addition of tags is not cumulative.
  - You can therefore remove all of a meeting’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
- This command may change the meeting that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewm` command, as detailed [here](#viewing-detailed-meeting-information--viewm).

Examples:
- `editm 1 a/Hawker Centre s/15.09.2023 1500` edits the location and start of the 1st meeting to be `Hawker Centre` and `15.09.2023 1500` respectively.
- `editm 2 m/Zoom meeting t/` edits the title of the 2nd meeting to be `Zoom meeting` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing detailed meeting information : `viewm`

Displays detailed information of a meeting in the details list.

Format: `viewm MEETING_INDEX`

- Displays the `TITLE`, `LOCATION`, `START`, `END`, `TAG` and attendees of the meeting at the specified `INDEX`.
- As this command displays the contact at the specified `MEETING_INDEX` in the meetings list, the meeting displayed in the details list may change due to a modification in list order through the use of `addm`, `editm` and `listm` commands. This is intentional.
- The displayed meeting is cleared from the details list when the `deletem` and `findm` commands are used.

Examples:
- `viewm 1` displays detailed information of the 1st meeting on the meetings list, including current attendees.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding meetings: `findm`

Finds meetings with details matching the keywords you specified for at least 1 of these fields: `TITLE`, `LOCATION`, `ATTENDEE_NAME`, `TAG`; and falls within the `START` and `END` times given.
The meetings list will be filtered to show only the results of this command.

Format: `findm [m/KEYWORDS] [a/KEYWORDS] [t/KEYWORDS] [n/ATTENDEE_NAME] [s/START e/END]`

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `shop` will return `SHOP`.
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Shop Meet` will return `Meet Shop`.
- `TITLE`, `LOCATION`, `TAG` and `ATTENDEE_NAME` are searched, within the time frame given by `START` and `END`.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Meet` will return `Meet with John` but not `Meeting`.
- If only one field is provided, all meetings matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). 
  - e.g. `m/Shop Meet` will return `Meeting: Shop at mall`, `Meeting: Meet client`.
- If multiple fields are provided, only meetings matching at least one keyword in each field will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). 
  - e.g. `m/Shop Meet a/Mall` will return `Meeting: Shop at mall, Location: Mall` but not `Meeting: Meet client, Location: Park`.
- This command clears the meeting that is currently displayed in the details list via the `viewm` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
- `findm m/project` returns all meetings with a title that contains `project`.
- `findm m/zoom meeting` returns all meetings with a title that contains at least one of `zoom` or `meeting`.
- `findm s/09.09.2023 0000 e/09.10.2023 0000` returns all meetings between 09.09.2023 0000 and 09.10.2023 0000.
- `findm m/Meeting s/18.10.2023 0000 e/18.10.2023 2359 n/John` returns `Meeting with friends`, as it starts after 18.10.2023 0000 and ends before 18.10.2023 2359, and is attended by John.

## Saving the data

OutBook's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that modifies the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

OutBook's data is saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/outbook.json`. If you are an experienced user, you may attempt to update data directly by editing this data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file render its format invalid, OutBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Follow these steps:
1. Install OutBook on the other computer following the same instructions as in the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start). An empty data file will be created in the same folder as the application. 
2. Replace this empty data file with the file that contains the data from your previous OutBook installation.
3. Your transferred data should now be visible upon launching OutBook.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. You can solve this by deleting the `preferences.json` file created by the application, before running the application again.
