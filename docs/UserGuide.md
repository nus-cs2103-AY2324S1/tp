## Product Overview

**Land the dream internship or job opportunity you've always wanted by networking more effectively using _NetworkBook!_**

NetworkBook is a desktop contact book application built for NUS Computing students and professionals to manage information about the people they network with more efficiently than ever before.

Here's an overview of how NetworkBook can help you manage your network of contacts better than existing alternatives:

* Search for and sort contacts by multiple networking-relevant fields (e.g. priority, courses taken/taking, specialization(s) taken/intending to take, graduation year)
* Access this application offline, with a static online page that contains user manual and download link
* Record only the information you find relevant on our application (e.g. you can assign one contact only their email and specialisation, and another contact nothing but their course)

On top of these advantages, we believe that contact management must be efficient. Therefore, NetworkBook is optimised for use via fully textual commands while still having an interactive and user-friendly visual interface. For fast typers, NetworkBook can get your contact managing done faster than existing alternatives performing a similar role.

## Features

<!-- @@author Singa-Pirate -->

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Fields of a contact**

In NetworkBook, details of a contact are categorised into different **fields**. Each field has a corresponding **prefix** in the command format. 

Some fields are **single-valued fields**, meaning that each contact has **only 1 value** for each of these fields.

| Single-valued fields | Prefix    | Format                                                                              | Remarks                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------------- |
| name                 | /name     | Any non-empty value comprising alphanumeric characters (and spaces, if any)         | If a contact's name contains non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. `/`), you may omit these characters in the name that you store. |
| priority level       | /priority | Either `high`, `medium` or `low`, or the initial alphabet                           | Not case-sensitive                                       |
| graduation semester  | /grad     | `AYxxxx-Sy`<br/><br/>e.g., `AY2223-S1` for Academic Year 20`22`/20`23` Semester `1` | `xxxx` is the 4-digit representation of 2 **consecutive** calendar years.<br/>Academic year must be between AY1970/1971 to AY2069/2070 (inclusive). <br/>`y` is either `1` for Semester 1, or `2` for Semester 2. |

Other fields are **multi-valued fields**. Each contact has a **list** of different values for each of these fields.

| Multi-valued fields | Prefix  | Format                                                       | Remarks                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| phone numbers       | /phone  | Valid phone number containing numbers and optional country code (1-3 numbers with `+` in front) if applicable | Phone number body (excluding country code) must be at least 3 digits long.<br/>Phone numbers with and without whitespace character are treated as different (e.g. `+6512345678` is different from `+65 12345678`). |
| email addresses     | /email  | Valid email with `@` (at sign) and `.` (period) present after `@` |-|
| links        | /link   | Valid URL link                                               | Link must be URL-encoded. That is, it must be the same as the URL that appears on the browser's URL bar after you visit the page. |
| courses             | /course | `course_name [/start date] [/end date]` <br/><br/>e.g., `CS2103T /start 01-09-2023 /end 01-12-2023` |`/start` and `/end` indicate when the contact started and finished taking the course respectively. <br/>A course can have no dates, a start date, or a start and end date.|
| specialisations     | /spec   | Any non-empty value                                          |-|
| tags                | /tag    | Any non-empty value                                          |-|

In NetworkBook, you can manage contact information by changing the fields assigned to them. Following are the commands you can use to manage fields of a contact:

| Command                                                          | How does it manage the fields                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [create](#create-new-contact-create-name-name-optional-fields)   | optionally initialise certain fields when creating new contact |
| [add](#add-details-to-contact-add-index-fields)                  | add more details to a field of a contact                       |
| [edit](#edit-contact-detail-edit-index-field-options)            | update some details about a field of a contact                 |
| [delete](#delete-some-details-delete-index-field-prefix-options) | delete some details from a field of a contact                  |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-secondary">

<span id="indices">:information_source: **Indices**</span>

In NetworkBook, you often need to provide an index to specify a contact, or an entry in a multi-valued field of a contact. Indices are **integers counted from 1**.

Make sure to provide indices that has a corresponding item in your NetworkBook. The exact valid range is from 1 to 2147483647 inclusive. If your command contains an invalid index, it will be considered an invalid command.

## FAQ

### Launching NetworkBook

**Q:** How can I launch NetworkBook if the clicking on the JAR file does not work on my Windows computer? <br/>
**A:** If you are familiar with the command prompt, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open command prompt on your computer
1. Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located using `cd [JAR file location]`
1. Type `java -jar networkbook.jar` and press enter
1. NetworkBook should launch

If you have any further issues, please raise an issue on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp). We will attend to you as soon as we can.

### Checking Java version

**Q:** How can I check my Java version? <br/>
**A:** Open command prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS or Linux) on your computer, and type `java -version`. If you do not have Java installed, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).

### Loading data from another device

**Q:** How can I load my contacts stored in NetworkBook used in another device? <br/>
**A:** Locate the data file stored at `[JAR file location]/data/networkbook.json`. Copy over the data file to the corresponding location on your current device. After that, launch NetworkBook to check whether your contact details have been loaded properly.

### Editing data file manually

**Q:** Can I edit the data file for NetworkBook manually (i.e. from outside the NetworkBook app)? <br/>
**A:** You can edit the data file for NetworkBook manually, but at your own risk (if there are errors in the file related to formatting/invalid data, the app will not read the data file and begin from an empty data file instead.)
