# Introduction - What is InterviewHub?

**InterviewHub**  is a desktop app for engineering hiring managers to schedule job interviews and manage applicants' contact information.
**InterviewHub** allows users to:
* seamlessly update and manage applicants for various job openings,
* schedule and keep track of interviews with each applicant,

through an all-in-one user-friendly platform!

It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI).
If you are an engineering hiring manager who has a good understanding of CLI-based applications and can type fast, **InterviewHub** can get your interview and applicant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-a n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-a n/John Doe`.

  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

# Known issues
