## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

    - To check your Java version, open Command Prompt if you are on Windows, or Terminal if you are on MacOS, and run `java --version`. If you do not have Java installed, you can install it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).

2. Download the latest `mediflowr.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/releases).

3. Create a folder in the location where you want the application to stay in, and copy the file into that folder.

    - This is necessary as the application will create additional files to store settings and the data itself, so this will nicely organise the files.

4. If you are familiar with _Command Prompt on Windows_ or _Terminal on MacOS_, navigate to the folder that you have just created using `cd` command and open the application using the `java -jar mediflowr.jar` command.

    - If you are not familiar, follow the instructions listed [here](#faq).

5. You should now be able to use the application.

    - If you wish to familiarise yourself with the application, you can follow the **tutorial** on how to use MediFlowR in the next section [here](#tutorial-for-new-users).

    - If you wish to learn more in depth about the **different features**, you can skip forward to this section [here](#features).

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I launch the MediFlowR application?<br>
**A**: The easiest way is to double-click the `mediflowr.jar` file and the application should launch. If that does not work,
follow the steps here:
1. Open Command Prompt if you are on Windows, or open Terminal if you are on MacOS.
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the `mediflowr.jar` file using the `cd` command. For example, if the file is
located at `C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads` on Windows or `~/Downloads` on MacOS, you can enter the command `cd C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads`
or `cd ~/Downloads` to navigate to that directory.
3. Open the `mediflowr.jar` file using the command `java -jar mediflowr.jar`. The application should launch afterwards.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: You can install MediFlowR on that other computer, then simply transfer over the `mediflowr.json` file located in the
data folder to the data folder on that other computer. The data folder is located at the same place as your MediFlowR application.

**Q**: How do I save my data after any changes I have made?<br>
**A**: The data is saved automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q** Can I edit the data file used by the application directly?<br>
**A**: MediFlowR data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/mediflowr.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, the application will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application, located in the same folder as the application, before running the application again.
