## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   For further information, you may refer to these guides on [how to check java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)
   and [how to install Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) if needed.

2. Download the latest `unofas.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your UNOFAS.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd`(change directory) into the folder you put the jar file in. For example, if the file is in
   your `Documents` folder, go to the terminal and type in `cd ~/Documents`.<br>
   Once you are in the selected folder, enter the `java -jar unofas.jar` command into the terminal
   to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press the Enter key to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all your client-contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 nk/David nkp/91234567` : Adds a contact named `John Doe`
   to the Contact Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the contact list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all client contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the application.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by users.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Unless explicitly allowed, blank inputs or inputting any number of spaces as an argument for a field is invalid.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Any input parameters that do not adhere to the accepted values will result in the command
  **failing and not executing**.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will
  be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple
  lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source:
**Do note** If the ADDRESS includes any recognized prefixes (leading space + prefix), users should be careful.
For instance, if you input `a/Blk 285 n/Clementi` for the ADDRESS argument, it will trigger the identification of the prefix `n/` in the input and result in an error message.
</div>

-----------------------
### Viewing help : `help`

---------------------------
### Adding a client-contact : `add`

Adds a client's contact (name, phone number, email, home address, next-of-kin name, next-of-kin phone

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS nk/NEXT_KIN nkp/NEXT_KIN_PHONE [fp/FINANCIAL_PLAN]… [t/TAG]…​`

* Adding a new client-contact with the exact same name (case-sensitive) as a client currently in the contact book counts as a
    duplicate and will cause the command to fail. Duplicate information in other fields does not count as a duplicate
    client.
* To prevent accidentally adding duplicates, you can use [Find](#locating-clients-by-name-financial-plan-andor-tag--find)
    to check if you have already added the client.
* After performing an add, the contact list will be reset to display all client contacts.
* You MAY NOT add an empty tag or financial plan eg.(`fp/` or `t/`)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source:

</div>

----------------------------
### Sorting of data : `sort`

Sorts all the client contacts with predefined sorting functionalities. After sorting the list, the ordering of the contacts
will be changed. As a result, performing any operations that require indexing (such as delete, add or edit), will reference the new ordering that is currently displayed on the screen.

**Here are the current predefined sorting functions that have been implemented**

* `name` : sorts list by lexicographical ordering of client name (case-insensitive).
* `appointment`: sorts list by appointment timing in order of the earliest appointment first. If no appointment is found, the remaining clients without an appointment will be displayed in an arbitrary order, based on the reordering of the previous sorting functions applied.

Format: `sort KEYWORD`

* Calling this command after a `Find` command will preserve the results filtered by the `Find` command.

Acceptable Values: Refer to [Argument Summary](#argument-summary).

Example: `sort name` performs sorting by lexicographical ordering

Successful Output: `4 persons listed!`

![result for`sort name'](images/sortUi.png)

------------
### Editing the data file

UNOFAS data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous UNOFAS home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When sorting the list**, we have chosen to not implement returning sorted list to original ordering due to the lack of necessity. However, due to feedback, we intend to implement this in the next release to enable users to return list to original order should they wish to.
3. **It is possible to add appointments with dates** before the current date and time.
4. **On macOS Systems**, you have to use the cursor to manually click the confirm or cancel buttons for the overriding and clear prompts. In contrast, Windows users can choose to hit enter to confirm execution of command.
5. **On macOS Systems**, executing clear and appointment override might result in some slight UI bugs when application is used in full screen. Don't worry as the program should still work with intended functionality.
6. **No current method to de-conflict clashing appointments**. Users should be advised to check the appointment list to ensure appointments do not clash with each other.
7. **The appointment list** may display appointments with the same date and time in a different order after adding a new appointment and subsequently reopening the app. This will be concurrently resolved when fixing issue 6.
8. **Checking for duplicate clients** is done by checking their full name, case-sensitive. The future plan is to do this by checking of phone number as it is less likely 2 people share the same phone number than compared to name.
