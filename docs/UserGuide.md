## Quick start

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `keepintouch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the [home directory](#home-directory) for your KeepInTouch app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the [home directory](#home-directory), and use the `java -jar keepintouch.jar` command to run the application. (A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.)
![GUI example](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will show the list of all available commands.<br>

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `delete contact CONTACT_ID`, `CONTACT_ID` is a parameter which can be used as `delete contact 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add contact -n NAME [-p PHONE_NUMBER] [-a ADDRESS] [-e EMAIL] [-t TAGNAME...]` can be used as `add contact -n Aaron -p 12345678 -a Baker Street 12 -e aaron123@gmail.com -t Frontend` or as `add contact -n Aaron -e aaron123@gmail.com`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[-t TAGNAME...]` can be used as `-t Frontend`, `-t Frontend -t Java` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-tit NOTE_TITLE -con NOTE_CONTENT`, `-con NOTE_CONTENT -tit NOTE_TITLE` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list contact` and `exit`, etc.) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Requirements and details on user supplied parameters:** <br>

* `CONTACT_ID` is the number that is on the left of the contact's name in each contact card.

## FAQ

**Q**: Why can't I run the app?<br>
**A**: Make sure you have [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed before running the app, and make sure you have followed the way mentioned in [Quick Start](#quick-start).

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another device?<br>
**A**: Please follow these steps:
  - Download the jar file for the app on the new device.
  - Copy the data folder from the old device to the new device, and put it in the [home directory](#home-directory) on the new device.
    - The data folder from the old device is located at [home directory](#home-directory)/data`. You need to copy the folder along with all files inside to the new device to complete data transfer.
  - Run the application on the new device. Now you should see the data from old device on your new device.
  - Similarly, if you want to move the jar file to another directory (change the [home directory](#home-directory)) within the same device, you also need to make sure that the `data` folder is always in the new [home directory](#home-directory) together with the jar file.

**Q**: Can I modify the data file outside the application itself?<br>
**A**: No, you **should _NOT_ directly modify the data file** outside the application at anytime, otherwise it may lead to unpredictable consequences and errors to the application.
