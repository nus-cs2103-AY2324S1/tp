efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

With _LetsGetHired_, you can benefit from:

  never forget key details.
- **Deadlines**: Set and track deadlines for your internship applications, so
  you never miss an opportunity.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and
efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is

GUI-based tools available.**

**_LetsGetHired_ is perfect for you if you are a Computer Science undergraduate
student.**

## **Commands**

This section explains the detailed list of the commands (and its usages) which
are available for you to use.

<box type="tip" seamless>

If you have been using **_LetsGetHired_** and just need a **quick refresher** on
the commands available, you can jump to
the [_Command Summary_ section of the **User Guide**](#command-summary) below.

</box>

<box type="info" light>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* All commands are case-sensitive. For example, `sort` is a valid command, but `SORT` or `SoRt` are invalid commands.<br>

* All prefixes are case-sensitive. For example, `s/` (the prefix for status) and `S/` (no attached meaning) are considered different.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are **parameters** which you will type in.<br>
    ```
    add n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE c/CYCLE
    ``` 
  For example, you can replace `COMPANY_NAME`, `ROLE` and `CYCLE` as follows:
    ```
    add n/Google r/Software Engineering c/Summer 2024
    ```

* All parameters should be preceded by its respective **prefix**.<br>
    ```
    add n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE c/CYCLE
    ``` 
  For example, `n/` is the prefix for the `COMPANY_NAME` parameter. `r/` is the
  prefix for `ROLE` and `c/` is the prefix for `CYCLE`.

    <box type="warning" light>

  **Exception**: The `INDEX` parameter does not require any prefix.
  </box>

* Words in `[square brackets]` are **optional parameters**.<br>
    ```
    add n/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE c/CYCLE [s/STATUS] [d/DEADLINE]
    ```
  For example, you can use the above command as:
    ```
    add n/Google r/Software Engineering c/Summer 2024
    ```
  OR
    ```
    add n/Google r/Software Engineering c/Summer 2024 s/Offered
    ```
  OR
    ```
    add n/Google r/Software Engineering c/Summer 2024 d/25 Oct 2023
    ```
  OR
    ```
    add n/Google r/Software Engineering c/Summer 2024 s/Offered d/25 Oct 2023
    ```

* You can type parameters in **any order**.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `c/CYCLE r/ROLE`, typing `r/ROLE c/CYCLE` is
  also acceptable.

* **Irrelevant parameters** for commands that do not take in parameters (such
  as `help` and `list`) **will be ignored**.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Viewing Your Internship Application: `view`

The `view` command is designed to offer a **detailed insight** into your
individual internship applications.

While a summarized list gives you an overview of all your applications,
the `view` command provides an in-depth look
at each application, showcasing the specifics and any attached notes. This
ensures you have comprehensive access to the
data when preparing for interviews, follow-ups, or making decisions.

##### Command Usage

**Command**:

```
view INDEX
```

##### Parameters:

1. **INDEX**: Represents the position of the internship application in your list
   that you wish to view in detail.
   <box type="info" seamless>

   The `INDEX` should be a positive integer. For example: `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
   This corresponds to the application's position in your list.
   </box>

##### Example:

If you wish to view the details of the first internship application on your
list, the command would be:

```
view 1
```

![View Command](images/commands/viewCommand.png)

After hitting `Enter`, you can see that the first internship application details
is displayed on the _Select View_ of the application.
Here, you can observe all the details of the application, including the
company's name, role, cycle, status, deadline,
and any attached notes. This meticulous breakdown ensures you're fully informed
and prepared for any next steps associated
with that particular application.

![View Command Result](images/commands/viewCommandResult.png)

<box type="tip" light>

* **Alternative**: You may also click on a _Internship Application Card_ to view
  the corresponding details.
* Utilize the `view` command prior to interviews or follow-ups to refresh your
  memory about the specifics of the application.
* Regularly reviewing applications in detail can help you stay on top of any
  action items or next steps.

### Searching Your Internship Application: `find`

The `find` command is a powerful tool designed to help you **quickly search and
locate specific internship applications**
based on various criteria.

Whether you're trying to find all applications for a specific company or filter
applications by their status, the `find`
command ensures you can effortlessly pinpoint the relevant records.

##### Command Usage

**Command**:

```
find [n/COMPANY_NAME] [r/ROLE] [c/CYCLE] [s/STATUS] [d/DEADLINE] [i/NOTE]
```

##### Parameters:

<box type="important" seamless>

At least **one** of the optional parameters must be provided.
</box>

1. **n/COMPANY_NAME** (Optional): Represents the company's name you're trying to
   search for.
1. **r/ROLE** (Optional): Refers to the specific internship role you wish to
   locate.
1. **c/CYCLE** (Optional): Identifies the internship cycle (
   e.g., `Summer`, `Winter`) you want to search for.
1. **s/STATUS** (Optional): Helps filter applications based on their current
   status.
1. **d/DEADLINE** (Optional): Locates applications by their deadline.
1. **i/NOTE** (Optional): Searches applications based on specific notes attached
   to them.

##### Example:

Suppose you want to quickly locate all your applications for the company 
**Google**. Your command would be:

```
find n/Google
```

![Find Command](images/commands/findCommand.png)

After hitting `Enter`, you can see that all the applications where the company
name matches or contains the keyword `Google`.

![Find Command Result](images/commands/findCommandResult.png)

<box type="info" light>

**Note about `find` command:**

1. **Partial Matches**: The `find` command is robust and recognizes partial
   matches. So, if you search for `Apl`, it'll show applications
   for `Apple`, `apple`, and even `Alphabet Limited`.
   <box type="warning" seamless>

   **Exception**: Partial Match does not work on `STATUS` parameter. You need to
   specify the full `STATUS` to search for them.
   </box>

1. **Multiple Criteria**: By adding multiple parameters, you can refine your
   search further. For instance, `find n/Google c/Summer s/Pending` would
   display applications that meet **ALL** the following criteria:
    * Company name contains `Google`
    * Cycle contains `Summer`
    * Status is `Pending`

</box>

<box type="tip" light>

This feature is particularly useful when you need a more refined list or when
you're unsure about the exact details but remember a few keywords.
