# Welcome to Connectify!

<p align="center">
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Connectify UI" width="650">
</p>

Connectify is a **desktop app for managing clients, optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary)**. Connectify helps salespersons manage their clients information records and data, boosting their efficiency in building customer relationships! If you can type fast, Connectify can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

In this user guide, you will find instructions on how to install Connectify and use its many features to manage your clients.

Choose a topic from the table of contents to find out how to manage your clients using Connectify!

# Quick start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 installed on your Computer.

2. Download the latest `connectify.jar` from our [releases](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases/).

3. Copy the file over to the folder you would want to use as the home folder for Connectify. An option is to create a folder named `Connectify` in your`Desktop` and place the file there.

4. Open the command terminal.

   a. For Windows, you can open `Command Prompt` from your list of installed applications.

   b. For macOS and other operating systems, open the `Terminal` app.

5. Change the directory of the terminal by using the `cd` command.

   a. For example, if you saved your file at `C:\Users\John\Desktop\Connectify\connectify.jar`, run the command `cd C:\Users\John\Desktop\Connectify` in your terminal.

6. Run `java -jar connectify.jar` to start the application.

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

7. A window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds, containing sample data.

   <figure>
       <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Connectify GUI during start-up">
       <figcaption align="center">
           <em>The GUI you see on start-up may be slightly different due to differences in data.</em>
       </figcaption>
   </figure>
   <br>

8. Type the [command](#if-youre-new-what-are-commands) in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.

   Some examples you can try:

   - `list`: Lists all client profiles.

   - `create n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: Creates a client named `John Doe` in the client list.

   - `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd contact currently shown in the displayed client list.

   - `exit`: Exits the app.

9. Refer to [Features](#features) below for more commands and details for each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# **If you're new**: what are commands?

Commands are the string of text you type into the command box. They usually start with a command word.

- e.g. `create n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` is a command. ***create*** is the command word.

Sometimes these commands require additional information. When creating our client, we need to specify the name, phone number, etc. These fields are called **parameters**.

**Parameters** are additional information to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. In `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/John Doe`.

For most commands, **parameters** are prefixed by **flags**. They are indicators to differentiate various parts of the command. They consist of a letter, followed by a `/`.

- e.g. In `n/NAME`, `n/` is the flag for the `NAME` parameter.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about commands**<br>

- Commands, flags and parameters are case-sensitive, unless otherwise specified.

- Items in square brackets are optional.

  e.g. `n/NAME [tg/TELEGRAM]` can be used as `n/John Doe tg/@johndoe` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `...` after them can be repeated any number of times, including zero.

  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as <code> </code> (0 times), `t/friend`, or `t/friend t/neighbour`, while
  `n/NAME` has to be used exactly once.

- Parameters can be entered in any order.

  e.g. If the command specifies its parameters as `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters will be ignored.

  e.g. The ***list*** command does not take in any parameters. If the command `list 123` is entered, it will be interpreted as `list`.

## Adding

### Adding a client profile: ***create***

Your job as a salesperson starts with adding a client profile to Connectify. This is a one-time process for each client that has been made simple for you.
Use the ***create*** command to add a client profile.

**Format**
```text
create n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]... [tg/TELEGRAM]
[pf/PROFESSION] [i/INCOME] [d/DETAILS]
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Unique profiles**<br>

Connectify checks for the uniqueness of a profile by its `NAME`. It doesn't allow you to create two profiles with the same name. If you happen to have two clients with the exact same name, we suggest differentiating them by adding some notes in brackets!

e.g. `John Doe (Company A)` vs `John Doe (Company B)`

</div>

**Example**
```text
create n/Bernice Yu p/99272758 e/berniceyu@example.com 
a/Blk 30 Lorong 3 Serangoon Gardens, #07-18 t/colleagues 
t/friends tg/@yuyubern pf/Graphic Designer i/60000
```

    <img src="images/ExampleCreateAfter.png" alt="Bernice Yu's client card after creating">
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>Result of executing the above create command: Bernice Yu's profile is at index 21. Indices may be different.</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

You should directly see the client profile added to the list of clients in the application window. After adding a client profile, you can now perform various operations on the client profile as specified in the next few sections!

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a client interaction: ***interaction***

After contacting your client, you may want to log your interactions with them. Use the ***interaction*** command when you want to record an interaction you had with a client.

**Format**
```text
interaction INDEX o/OUTCOME [DETAILS]
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the interaction command**<br>

- `INDEX` refers to the index of the client profile in the displayed list of clients.

- At least one of the `OUTCOME` or `DETAILS` parameters must be provided.

- `OUTCOME` must be one of the following: `INTERESTED`, `NOT_INTERESTED`, `CLOSED`, `UNKNOWN`.

- `OUTCOME` is not case sensitive. `interested` is also a valid outcome.

</div>

**Example**
```
interaction 21 o/INTERESTED First meeting with client, she seems interested!
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Viewing

Sometimes, you may want to view the details of a client profile or the interactions you have had with a client to quickly catch up before contacting them.

This section contains multiple commands that allow you to view various details of your clients that are collated in a single view for your convenience.

### Viewing the dashboard: ***dashboard***

To keep track of comprehensive statistics about your performance, Connectify provides you with the ***dashboard*** command.
Use the ***dashboard*** command to view summarised information on your client interactions and your important follow-ups.

**Format**
````text
dashboard
````

You should see the following dashboard view in the application window.

<figure>
   <p align="center">
      <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Dashboard view" width="400">
   </p>
   <figcaption align="center">
       <em>The dashboard view. Data shown may vary.</em>
   </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

See [what each section of the dashboard means.](#dashboard-information)

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Viewing the list of clients: ***list***

From the dashboard, you may wish to see a comprehensive list of your clients. Use the ***list*** command to view all clients.

**Format**
```text
list
```

<figure>
   <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ExampleEditBefore.png" alt="Client list view" width="450">
   </p>
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>The client list view. Data shown may vary.</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

You should then see the list of clients in the application window.

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing the full details of a client: ***view***

Catching up on the details of a client before contacting them is important. Most of the time, remembering the details of previous interactions with a client is difficult as the data is scattered everywhere.

Connectify gives you the powerful ***view*** command to view the full details of a client profile in a single view.

**Format**
```text
view INDEX
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the view command**<br>

`INDEX` refers to the index of the client profile in the displayed list of clients.

</div>

**Example**
```text
view 3
```

<figure>
   <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ExampleEditBefore.png" alt="Client list view" width="500">
   </p>
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>The client list view. Note that David's profile is at index 3.</em>

</figure>
<br>

<figure>
   <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ExampleViewAfter.png" alt="Detailed view of David's profile" width="500">
   </p>
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>Result of executing the above view command: David's profile details are shown.</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Finding a client by name: ***find***

Managing a large client list can be difficult. Sometimes their index on the list can be hard to remember and this could affect your experience keying in certain commands. Don't worry though, we have a solution for you! The ***find*** command allows you to search for a client by name, and you can use this client's index (usually 1) in other commands.

**Format**
```text
find NAME
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the find command**<br>

You need to type either the **first**, **middle** or **last** name of the client. You cannot type a partially spelt name!

</div>

**Example**
```text
find David
```

<figure>
   <p align="center">
       <img src="images/ExampleEditBefore.png" alt="Client list view" width="500">
   </p>
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>The client list view. Data shown may vary.</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

   </p>
    <figcaption align="center">
        <em>Result of executing the above find command: David's profile is found at index 1. Indices may be different.</em>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Editing

### Editing a client profile: ***edit***

Over time, you may need to update the details of a client profile to reflect the most current information. Use the command ***edit*** to edit the specified client profile in your client list.

**Format**
```text
edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]... [l/LEAD] 
[tg/TELEGRAM] [pf/PROFESSION] [i/INCOME] [d/DETAILS]
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the edit command**<br>

- `INDEX` refers to the index of the client profile in the displayed list of clients.

- At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.

</div>

Example
1. `edit 1 l/HOT`
2. `edit 2 e/charoliveiro@gmail.com p/123456789`
3. `edit 3 t/buddies t/relatives`

    </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Clearing all tags of a client

You can use the ***edit*** command to clear all tags of a client by supplying an empty tag parameter! For example, if you wish to clear the tags of a client at index 4, use `edit 4 t/`.

#### Editing a single field

We understand the ***edit*** command can be a little tedious to use if you only want to edit a single field of a client profile. Hence, we have provided a shortcut for you to edit a single field of a client profile. This command is special because its command word is the same as the field you want to edit. 

**Format**
```text
FIELD INDEX NEW_VALUE
```

**Example**

- `name 1 John Doe`: Changes the name of the client at index 1 to `John Doe`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about this shortcut**<br>

- `INDEX` refers to the index of the client profile in the displayed list of clients.

- All valid `FIELD` parameters: ***name***, ***phone***, ***email***, ***address***, ***lead***, ***telegram***, ***profession***, ***income***, ***details***.

- This does not work for the client's tags.

</div>

#### Common use case: marking a client as a hot, warm, or cold lead

As salespeople, we need to gauge the likelihood of a client of becoming a buying customer. We use hot leads to represent a customer with high potential, and cold leads to represent customers with low potential.

You can use the ***lead*** command to mark a client as a **hot**, **warm** or **cold** lead. For example, if you wish to mark the client at index 4 as a cold lead, enter `lead 4 cold`. 

Note that this [changes the follow-up period of the client](#follow-up-calculation).

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deleting

### Deleting a client profile: ***delete***

Keep the list of clients in Connectify clean by deleting client profiles that are no longer relevant.

Deleting a client profile is easy with the ***delete*** command.

**Format**
```text
delete INDEX
```

**Example**
```
delete 1
```

### Deleting all clients: ***clear***

If you want a fresh start, use the ***clear*** command. **Be careful**, this clears your entire client list!

**Format**
```text
clear
```

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exiting the program: ***exit***

Quits the Connectify application.

**Format**
```text
exit
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Miscellaneous Notes

## Follow-up Calculation

The follow-up date is calculated by the day of last interaction plus a follow-up period, determined by lead type as shown:

| Lead Type | Follow-Up Time |
|-----------|----------------|
| HOT       | 1 week         |
| WARM      | 4 weeks        |
| COLD      | 8 weeks        |
| UNKNOWN   | 4 weeks        |


For example, if your last interaction with John is on `1 Jan 2021` and he is a `HOT` lead, the follow-up date will be 1 week after `1 Jan 2021`, which is `8 Jan 2021`.

## Parameter constraints

Some parameters have constraints on the inputs they accept. Although our app notifies you of such issues when they arise, this section lists some common constraints worth noting.

### Phone numbers
Phone numbers can only 3-15 contain digits. An optional `+` sign is allowed in front.

### Tags

The tag parameter `t/TAG` only allows alphanumeric inputs with no spaces. For example, `t/familyfriend` is allowed, but `t/family friend` or `t/family-friend` is not allowed.

### Incomes

Incomes consist only of numerical inputs. Connectify does not yet support:
* Decimal values `600.50`
* Currencies `10000 USD`
* Other non-numeric input e.g. `10,000`

## Command history
You can use the **up arrow key <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>** to view your past commands and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute them again.

This is especially useful if you find yourself having to re-enter a command that was not accepted due to an error. For example, your parameters may not have conformed to the constraints above.

# Known Issues

## New follow-ups may not be added after a client is marked as a "hotter" lead

Changing a client's lead to a "hotter" lead, e.g. from `COLD` to `HOT`, may not add a new follow-up to the dashboard. This is because the follow-up date is calculated based on the client's last interaction date and the lead type. Since a hotter lead type has a shorter follow-up period, if the new follow-up date has already passed, no follow-ups are added to the dashboard for the client.

## Follow-ups do not update automatically on a new day

The content of the dashboard will only update whenever the view is switched to the dashboard. This means that if you leave the dashboard open overnight, the follow-ups will not be updated until you switch to the client view and then back to the dashboard view.
