3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the **home folder** for your ManaGease. 
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in(i.e. `cd DIRECTORY_PATH`), and enter the `java -jar ManaGease.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add /n Jane Smith /e jane@email.com /p 12345678 /a 123 Main St /b 123456789 /jd 12/09/2023 /s 1000.00 /l 10`: Adds an employee named `Jane Smith` to ManaGease

   * `edit 2 /n Betsy Crower` : Edits the name of the 2nd employee to be `Betsy Crower`.

   * `clear` : Deletes all employees.

Refer to [Command Summary](#command-summary) below for a summary of all commands, and the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

* For a quick glance at all the commands and features, please refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `edit INDEX /n NAME`, `INDEX` and `NAME` are parameters which can be used as `edit 3 /n John Doe`.

* Commands, prefixes and most parameters are to be entered in lower case. You can only enter capitalized letters for parameters of `NAME`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS`.<br>

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `/n NAME [/t TAG]` can be used as `/n John Doe /t friend` or as `/n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[/t TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `/t friend`, `/t friend /t family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/n NAME /p PHONE_NUMBER`, `/p PHONE_NUMBER /n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
