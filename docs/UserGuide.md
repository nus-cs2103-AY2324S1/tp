## 1. Introduction

TAvigator is a **desktop app** targeted towards Teaching Assistants **for managing contacts, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type
fast, TAvigator can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. We offer a one-stop
solution to manage your student details including attendance records.

## 4. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TUTORIAL_GROUP_ID]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/G01` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `|` indicate that the command accepts either parameters.<br>
  e.g `mark n/STUDENT_NAME | id/STUDENT_ID` takes in `STUDENT_NAME` or `STUDENT_ID` as its first argument.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TUTORIAL_GROUP_ID]…​` can be used as many times as desired (i.e. 0 times), `t/T01`, `t/T01 t/B14` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

TAvigator data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/tavigator.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAvigator will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run, containing an address book called "TEMP". If any address book's data is invalid, it would not be shown and TAvigator will only show valid address books. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

#### 4.5.3 Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAvigator home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **Not adhering to format specified** for the commands currently may result in unexpected outcome/command to behave in-deterministically (I.e. Command fails/ adopts last value of redundant parameter). The workaround this known issue is to strictly stick to number and format of parameters specified in this UserGuide as mentioned in features.

3. **Adding invalid and redundant prefixes** after commands will case TAvigator to intake the invalid prefix and its value as part of the command, causing the command to fail. The remedy is to remove the invalid and redundant prefixes.

4. **Trying to use help command with no courses** will result in `Please create an address book using the create command first` message. You can create an address book using `course create course/COURSE_CODE` to work around this issue.

5. **Viewing attendance records** may not return the attendance records in chronological order. This will be fixed in a future version!
