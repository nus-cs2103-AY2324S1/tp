# Overview

**Class Manager 2023** is an offline desktop application for CS2103/T: Software Engineering Teaching Assistants (TAs) in National University of Singapore (NUS) to manage their students' contacts and [Class Information](#glossary).

**Class Manager 2023** allows users to:
* store and manage students' contact information across classes,
* keep track of and visualise student's Class Information such as attendance, class participation and assignment grades,
* easily mark the attendance of multiple students for each tutorial session,
* and much more!

**Class Manager 2023** is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface ([CLI](#glossary)) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface ([GUI](#glossary)). Since CS2103/T TAs have an adequate understanding of CLI, **Class Manager 2023** will allow class management tasks to be completed faster than traditional GUI apps.

# Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters that follow a prefix.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `n/` is the name prefix while `NAME` is a parameter. You need to provide the name parameter and the command can become `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be written in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command you execute has parameters `n/NAME c/CLASS_NUMBER`, `c/CLASS_NUMBER n/NAME` is also treated as the same parameters.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that **do not** take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command you execute is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that **do** take in parameters will invalidate the command.<br>
  e.g. if the input command is `delete 123 s/A0249112A` or `delete s/A0249112A c/T11`, the command will be invalid.<br>
  Please **refrain** from using prefixes as parameters for another prefix.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines, as space characters surrounding line breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

## Class Number

Class Number refers to the unique alphanumeric string used to identify tutorial sessions in NUS. In **Class Manager 2023**:

* Class Number is case-sensitive and must begin with the capital letter "T", followed by any number of characters. 
* Class Numbers must not be blank.
* Class Number is stored verbatim based on your input, with the case being preserved.
* Here are some valid examples of Class Numbers:
    - `T11`
    - `TG11`
    - `TG10B`

## Student Number

Student Number refers to the unique matriculation number of a NUS student. **Class Manager 2023** uniquely identifies each student in most commands using the Student Number. In **Class Manager 2023**:

* Student Number must begin with the capital letter "A", followed by 1 or more consecutive digits, and end with a single alphabetical character. 
* Student Number must not be blank.
* The last alphabetical character of Student Number is automatically converted to uppercase when stored in **Class Manager 2023**.
* Student Number is not case-sensitive, e.g. Student Number `A123V` and `A123v` refer to the same student.
* Here are some valid examples of Class Numbers:
    - `A0123456X`
    - `A32g (Stored as A32G)`

## Name

Names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank.

## Data visualisation

Data visualisation of student's Class Information is automatically generated in the Data Visualisation section of the GUI (within the card of a student in the Student List section).
* There will be 3 bar graphs, each representing the student's average grades, attendance and class participation percentages respectively.
* This provides a quick overview of the student's performance in the module and allows for easy comparison between students.

## Command navigation

**Class Manager 2023** allows you to navigate to previously entered commands using the arrow keys. Navigate to earlier commands using the **up arrow** key and more recent commands using the **down arrow** key.

## Saving your data

**Class Manager 2023** data is automatically saved on your computer after any command modifies the data. There is no need to save manually.

## Editing the data file

**Class Manager 2023's** data is saved as a [JSON](#glossary) file at `[JAR file location]/data/classmanager.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file. You can refer to a valid sample of the JSON file in the image below. 

<img alt="sample_contents" src="images/sample-contents.png" width="750"> <br>

Before loading the edited data file, you can configure **Class Manager 2023** using the `config` command to ensure your data file matches the configuration of **Class Manager 2023**. The size of the `attendanceTracker` and `classParticipationTracker` arrays must match the configured tutorial count. Similarly, the size of the `assignmentTracker` array must match the configured assignment count. In the image above, the data file can only be loaded if **Class Manager 2023** has been configured to have 10 tutorials and 4 assignments, as deduced from the size of the relevant arrays. **Class Manager 2023** is configured to have 13 tutorials and 6 assignments by default. 


<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid (missing value pairs or not matching the configured tutorial and assignment count), **Class Manager 2023** will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, creating a backup of the file before editing is recommended.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Commands

## Essential commands

### Configure Class Manager 2023 : `config`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:**
Configuring **Class Manager 2023** resets all students' Class Information, as well as the past states of **Class Manager 2023**. This **cannot** be undone using the `undo` command. It is recommended to configure **Class Manager 2023** before adding students.

</box>

Before you begin using **Class Manager 2023**, it is recommended that you configure the number of tutorials and assignments that your module has. This can be done using the `config` command, which allows **Class Manager 2023** to automatically generate the correct number of Class Information fields for each student. <br><br>
**Class Manager 2023** can be configured _at any time_, but do take note of the warning above regarding **loss** of student data and past **Class Manager 2023** states. If you configure **Class Manager 2023** after adding students, each student will have the correct number of tutorials and assignments. However, their Class Information data will be **reset**, and there will be no previous states of **Class Manager 2023** you can return to via the `undo` command.

Format: `config #t/TUTORIAL_COUNT #a/ASSIGNMENT_COUNT`

* `TUTORIAL_COUNT` and `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` must be a positive integer between 1 and 40 inclusive.
* Inputting the same `TUTORIAL_COUNT` and `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` as the previous configuration will also **reset** the Class Information of all students.
* `config` resets the state history of **Class Manager 2023**, preventing you from using the `undo` command to reach a state of **Class Manager 2023** before executing the `config` command.

Examples:
* `config #t/6 #a/5`

Before `config #t/6 #a/5` is executed:

<img alt="config before" src="images/config-before.png" width="700"> <br>

After `config #t/6 #a/5` is executed successfully and `view s/A0247243A` is executed to view the first student's Class Information:

<img alt="config success" src="images/config-success.png" width="700"> <br>

Possible errors and their corresponding error messages:
* If `TUTORIAL_COUNT` or `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` is missing
    * Error message: `Invalid command format! 
        config: Configures Class Manager with the module information.
        WARNING: Configuring Class Manager resets the grades, attendance and class participation details of all students. This cannot be undone.
        The default Class Manager is configured with 13 tutorials and 6 assignments.
        Parameters: #t/TUTORIAL_COUNT #a/ASSIGNMENT_COUNT
        Example: config #t/10 #a/4`
* If `TUTORIAL_COUNT` or `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` is less than 1 
    * Error message: `Invalid count values! The count value of tutorials/assignments cannot be less than 1.`
* If `TUTORIAL_COUNT` or `ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` is more than 40
    * Error message: `Invalid count values! The count value of tutorials/assignments cannot be more than 40.`

Format: `load f/FILE_NAME`
* File name must not include the .json extension.
* File name is case-insensitive
* The file must be valid and exist in the `/data` folder.
* The number of tutorials and assignments in the loaded file must be the same as the current configuration of **Class Manager 2023**. Using the `config` command, you can reconfigure **Class Manager 2023** to match the number of tutorials and assignments in the loaded file.
* `load` resets the state history of **Class Manager 2023**, preventing you from using the `undo` command to reach a state of **Class Manager 2023** before executing the `load` command.

Example:
* `load f/sample` loads `sample.json` file in the `/data` folder.

Before `load f/sample` is executed:

### Tag a student : `tag`

Tags the existing student in **Class Manager 2023**.

Format: `tag s/STUDENT_NUMBER [/add] [/delete] t/[TAG]…​`

* Tags the student with the specified [`STUDENT_NUMBER`](#student-number).

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** When editing tags without `/add` or `/delete`, the existing tags of the student will be overwritten.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** You can remove all the student’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

</box>

Examples:
* `tag s/A1234567N t/smart t/shy t/funny` replace all tags of the specified student with `smart`, `shy` and `funny`.
* `tag s/A1234567N /add t/Java` adds the `Java` tag to the specified student.
* `tag s/A1234567N /delete t/shy` removes the `shy` tag from the specified student.
* `tag s/A1234567N t/` clears all tags from the specified student.

The following image shows a successful execution of the `tag` command that replaces all the student's tags.

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install **Class Manager 2023** on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with your saved data file.
<br><br>
**Q**: How do I save a file with a different name?<br>
**A**: You can rename the file manually after saving it. Launch **Class Manager 2023** and use the `load` command to load the renamed file. Note that the renamed file will then become the new default save file.
<br><br>
**Q**: I am unable to load my save file. What should I do?<br>
**A**: Ensure that the save file is located in the `[JAR file location]/data` folder and that the file name is valid. In addition, make sure that the number of tutorials and assignments in the save file is the same as the current configuration of **Class Manager 2023**. Using the `config` command, you can reconfigure **Class Manager 2023** to match the number of tutorials and assignments in the save file.
<br><br>
**Q**: I am unable to load my save file after trying all the solutions above. What should I do?<br>
**A**: The save file may be corrupted. You can try manually editing the save file to fix it. You can refer to [this section](#editing-the-data-file) for more information on the valid format of the data file.
<br><br>
**Q**: How do I change the save file location?<br>
**A**: The save file is located at `[JAR file location]/data`. We currently do not support changing the save file location.
<br><br>
**Q**: Why does the GUI open off-screen?<br>
**A**: This is a known issue with JavaFX when you have multiple screens. If you move the application to a secondary screen and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file before running **Class Manager 2023** again.
<br><br>
**Q**: I have found a bug with **Class Manager 2023**. How can I report it?<br>
**A**: Please report the bug by creating a new issue on the [Class Manager 2023 issue tracker](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/issues).
