   Here are some example commands you can try:

   - `list`: Lists all teaching assistants.
   - `add n/Snowball p/98765432 e/snowball@example.com tele/@snowball t/fulltime c/CS1231S h/10`: Adds a teaching assistant named Snowball to the list.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

- Index does not correspond to a TA: For example, there are only 5 TAs but the user tried to delete a TA at index 6

### Finding a Teaching Assistant: `find`

Finds specified teaching assistants from the address book using search parameters.

Format: `find PREFIX KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

- We can search by name, course or free time, using the prefixes `n/`, `c/` or `d/ from/ to/` respectively.
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `alex` will match `Alex`, `cs1231s` will match `CS1231S`.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Alex` will not match `Alexis`, `cs1231` will not match `cs1231s`.
- We can apply multiple search filters to narrow down the search results, through including multiple filters in 
one command.
- Teaching assistants matching all the search parameters will be returned.
- The search filters are applied to the original list of TAs, not the current view of TAs.

Examples:

- `find n/Alex` returns all teaching assistants with names containing `alex` (e.g. `Alex Yeoh`).
- `find c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants that are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants that are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.
- `find n/Alex c/cs1231s` returns all teaching assistants with names containing `alex` and are teaching `cs1231s`.
- `find c/cs2103t d/1 from/10:00 to/12:00` returns all teaching assistants that are teaching `cs2103t` and are free on `Monday` from `10:00` to `12:00`.

![find TA](images/findTA.png)

When the command succeeds:

```
Filters applied: [filters applied by the user]
[number of TAs found] persons listed!
```

When the command fails:

- Incorrect format (missing prefix or parameter): `Invalid command format!`

### Viewing Teaching Assistants: `list`

Displays a list of all teaching assistants in the address book.

Format: `list`

![list TA](images/listTA.png)

When the command succeeds:

```
Listed all teaching assistants
[list of TAs]
```

### Updating Hours for All TAs in View: `hour`

Updates the hour field to all TAs in the current list.

Format: `hour HOUR`

- This command update ths hour field for all TAs in view, by adding the `HOUR` value to their current values. This `HOUR` value can be both negative and positive.
- This command can be applied after the `find` command. e.g First type `find c/ CS2103T` will find all TAs with course
`CS2103T`, then type `hour 6` will add 6 hours to all `CS2103T` TAs only, other TAs will not be updated.
- The resulting working hour after updating should still be within range of 0-9999.

Examples:

- `hour 4` will add 4 hours to all TAs in the address book if you are at the default view of all TAs.
- `find c/CS1231S` then `hour 4` will add 4 hours to all `CS1231S` TAs and other TAs will not be affected.

![update Hour](images/addHours.png)

When the command succeeds:

```
Hour updated to all TAs identified!
```

When the command fails:

- Invalid command format (updated new hour is invalid, either below 0 or above 9999): `Invalid command format!`

### Editing free time for a Teaching Assistant: `editft`

Edits the free time for a specified day for a TA with a specified index.

Format: `editft INDEX d/DAY from/FROM to/TO`

- This command update ths time interval for the TA at the specified `INDEX` for weekday `DAY`.
- Weekday `DAY` should be between 1 and 5, inclusive, and `FROM` and `TO` should be in "HH:SS" format and `FROM` time should be before `TO` time.
- All three prefixes must be present and all respective parameters need to be correctly given for the command to be executed.

Examples:

- `editft 1 d/2 from/13:00 to/15:00` will update the free time of the TA with index 1 by setting his Tuesday free time to be 13:00 to 15:00.

![update Hour](images/editFreeTime.png)

When the command succeeds:

```
Edited Teaching Assistant: [Details of TA specified]
```

When the command fails:

- Incorrect format (missing prefix or parameter, or `DAY` out of range, or invalid `FROM` or `TO` format): `Invalid command format!`
- Index out of range: `The person index provided is invalid`

### Viewing course information : `course`

Displays course information and tutorial timings.

Format: `course c/COURSE_CODE`

Example: `course c/CS2103T` returns the course information and tutorial timings for CS2103T.

![view course](images/viewCourse.png)

When the command succeeds:
```
Course: CS2103T Software Engineering
CS2103T Lecture 10:00-12:00
CS2103T Tutorial 10:00-12:00
CS2103T Laboratory 10:00-12:00
```

### Adding a default course : `teach`

Adds a default course to the address book.

The default course is usually the course that you are currently teaching.

This command will add a default course to the address book.

Format: `teach c/COURSE_CODE`

Expected outcome:
- Updates the name of the window with the default course.
- Filters the list of TAs teaching under the course automatically.
- The default course is saved even after you close the application. 
- The next time you open the application, the list of TAs will be automatically filtered based on your default course.

Example: `teach c/CS2103T` sets the default course to the course CS2103T.

![teach command](images/teachCourse.png)

When the command succeeds:

```CS2103T is successfully added as default course.```

When the command fails:
- Incorrect format (e.g., missing information): `Invalid command format!`
- Invalid course code: `Course codes should have 2-3 alphabets, followed by 4 digits,
  and optionally end with an alphabet.`
- Valid course code, but course not found: `Course not found.`

### Reset the default course : `clearteach`

Resets the default course in the address book.

This will revert the changes made by the `teach` command.

If no default course is set, the command will execute successfully but nothing will happen.

Example: `clearteach`

![clearteach command](images/clearTeach.png)

When the command succeeds:

```Default course has been cleared!```

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAManager.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
