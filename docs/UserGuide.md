**Connexion** is a desktop application for you to manage your networking connections.
* All interface is through a text UI in-app that operates similarly to a Command Line Interface (CLI).
* You can view their connections on a neat Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you:
1. are a **fast** typer, and
2. prefer a **lightweight** user interface instead of fancy graphics,

Then **Connexion** is for you!

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` and run as shown from [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/run.html).

3. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Before you begin:**
If there is no data file, either because this is the first time you've started **Connexion** or because you deleted the file, the app will fill with an example dataset. You may enter `clear` to clear them. These are present just as an example, and can otherwise be disregarded.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...​` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Leading & trailing whitespaces are ignored from the input for parameters. <br>
  e.g. `n/​ ​ NAME`, `n/NAME ​ ​` and `n/NAME` are interpreted in the same way.

* As seen above, the app uses prefixes to indicate the type of parameter, like `n/` for `NAME`. 
  * Prefixes are defined by having a space before the prefix proper. <br>
    e.g. `n/ Johnp/123456789` will be interpreted as supplying `Johnp/123456789` to the `NAME` parameter.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do take in parameters, but do not take in those specific parameters will be interpreted as part of the input. <br>
  e.g. `edit 1 n/John Doe m/` will be interpreted as supplying `John Doe m/` to the  `NAME` field, and be invalid.
  This is as `edit` does not make use of the `m/` prefix.

* Commands that modify contacts' detail or create contacts, i.e. `add` and `edit`, time-stamp the contact with a last modified field.
  * `mark` is not considered as modifying contact's detail and hence does not change the last modified date.
* Commands that accept indices as parameters can only accept positive integers less than or equal to 2147483647, and a valid index. <br>
  * A valid index must be a positive integer between 1 and the minimum of {displayed list size, 2147483647} (inclusive).
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the **displayed contact list**.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Adding a new contact : `add`

Creates a new contact and adds it to the app.

Format: ```add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL c/COMPANY j/JOB [t/TAG]...```

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A contact can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Tags cannot include spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. 
We suggest using **PascalCase** or **camelCase** if you want multiple words in a single tag.
</div>

* Does not allow contacts with duplicate full names to be added. (case-sensitive)
  * E.g. Contacts with name "A" and "a" can co-exist in the contact list, but not "A" and "A".
* Sets the last modified time of the given contact to the current time when executed.

Examples:
* `add n/John Wick p/12345678 e/johnwick@gmail.com c/Google j/Software Engineer t/NUS t/metInHackathon`
* `add n/Aiken Duit p/88888888 e/aikenduit@hotmail.com c/Meta j/Data Engineer`

### Listing all contacts : `list`

Gives the list of all contacts.

Format: `list`

* Allows the user to clear existing filters on the contact list.
  * E.g. `filter m/` followed by `list` clears the filter for marked contacts and displays all contacts instead.

### Editing existing contact details : `edit`

Edits an existing contact details via index.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [c/COMPANY] [j/JOB] [t/TAG]...​`<br>
(At least one of the optional fields must be provided.)

* Edits the contact at the specified `INDEX`.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values. Appending is not supported.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the contact will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
  * You can remove all the contact’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
  * This is the only time `t/` will allow no parameters.
* Same as `add`, no duplicate names (case-sensitive) are allowed.
* Updates the last modified time of the given contact to the current time when executed.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 n/John Sick p/87654321 t/` edits the 1st contact’s name, phone number and clears the tags in the current displayed list.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd contact to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Marking contacts of interest : `mark`

Marks a contact of interest, which is shown by a yellow filled star ★.

Format: `mark INDEX`

* Marks the contact at the specified `INDEX`.
* When a new contact is created, the contact is un-marked by default.
* Does NOT update the last modified time of the given contact to the current time when executed.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `mark 2` marks the 2nd contact in the contact list as contact of interest.

### Un-marking contacts of interest : `unmark`

Un-marks a contact of interest, which is shown by a yellow hollow star ☆.

Format: `unmark INDEX`

* Un-marks the contact at the specified `INDEX`.
* When a new contact is created, the contact is un-marked by default.
* Does NOT update the last modified time of the given contact to the current time when executed.

Examples:
* `unmark 1` un-marks the 1st contact in the current displayed list.

### Filtering a contact via a specified field : `filter`

Displays all contacts filtered via a specified field.

Supports 2 formats: <br>
Format 1: `filter FIELD_PREFIX_1 KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` <br>
Format 2: `filter FIELD_PREFIX_2` <br>

* FIELD_PREFIX: represents the field to filter by.
    * Example: if filter by company, FIELD_PREFIX = “c/”.
    * FIELD_PREFIX_1: one of "n/", "p/", "e/", "c/", "j/", "t/".
    * FIELD_PREFIX_2: one of "m/", "u/".
    * Refer to [Command Field Prefix Summary](#command-field-prefix-summary) for more information about the prefixes.
* Only supports filtering via ONE field.
    * Everything after FIELD_PREFIX_1 will be recognized as keywords, **including field prefixes**!
      * E.g. `filter n/ John u/` will be interpreted as a command to filter in the `NAME` field with argument `John u/`
    * Any keywords behind FIELD_PREFIX_2 will be ignored but the command is still valid, **including field prefixes**!
      * E.g. `filter u/ n/John` will be interpreted the same as `filter u/`.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `google` will match `Google`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Google Meta` will match `Meta Google`.
* Only returns results with at least one FULL matching keyword to the field (i.e. `OR` search). <br>
  e.g. `n/Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

Examples:
* `filter c/Google` returns all entries with company fields “Google”, “google” “Google Inc.”.
* `filter t/friends` returns all entries with the tag “friends”.

### Scheduling a meeting with a specific contact : `schedule`

Schedules a meeting with an existing contact.

Format: `schedule INDEX i/SCHEDULE_TIME [a/SCHEDULE_NAME]`

* Adds a schedule to the contact at the specified `INDEX`.
* Schedule name is an optional field. If no schedule name is given, the default is `Meeting`.
* Input schedule time must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm`, and must be valid.
* If there are existing schedules or schedule names, it will be updated to the input schedule and schedule name. 
  * Only supports one schedule per person at a time.
* Updates the last modified time of the given contact to the current time when executed.
* This command allows the entering of dates before the current date & time, e.g. in the event that you are backdating a meeting that has occurred for your own usage in documentation.

Examples:
*  `schedule 1 i/2023-12-07-13-45` edits or adds the displayed 1st contact's schedule time and name, where the schedule time is `7 Dec 2023, 13:45:00`, and the schedule name is the default name, `Meeting`.
*  `schedule 3 i/2024-05-06-18-00 a/Evening seminar` edits or adds the displayed 3rd contact's schedule time and name, where the schedule time is `6 May 2024, 18:00:00`, and the schedule name is `Evening seminar`.

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the application before running the application again.
