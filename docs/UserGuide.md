## 2. Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Java version `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   - You may refer to [this guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/check-java-verison) to check the Java version running on your computer.
   - If your computer is not running Java version `11` or above, you may download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
   
   <br>

2. Download the latest `wedlog.jar` file by clicking [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-2/tp/releases/download/v1.4/wedlog.jar).

3. Move the `wedlog.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for WedLog. You are encouraged to create a new folder specifically for WedLog and to move the `wedlog.jar` file into that folder. All data created by WedLog will be stored in this folder. 

4. Open the WedLog application by double-clicking on the `wedlog.jar` file. If this does not work, [open your computer's terminal](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-guide-to-using-command-line-terminal-96815b97b955), [navigate to the folder](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html) containing `wedlog.jar`, and type `java -jar wedlog.jar` to start the application.
   
5. A window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

## 3. Understanding the WedLog Interface

In this section, we give a comprehensive breakdown of the WedLog interface, offering insights into its intuitive design and functionality. Explore the components below to gain a comprehensive understanding of how WedLog simplifies wedding planning.

<pic src="images/understanding-interface/ui-overview.png" alt="Screenshot of the user interface overview"></pic>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.1. User Input and Feedback

WedLog is optimised for keyboard-based interaction to enhance the efficiency of your wedding planning process. This interaction is facilitated by the command box and result display boxes.

<pic src="images/understanding-interface/input-output.png" alt="Screenshot of the command box and result display"></pic>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.1.1. Command box

The command box is the gateway for you to interact with WedLog, allowing you to seamlessly execute various functions. Simply type a command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it.

<br />

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.1.2. Result display

Complementing the command box is the result display, where WedLog presents relevant responses based on the executed commands. When a command is successfully executed, a success message will be displayed. When an invalid command is entered, an error message will be displayed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.2. Lists

WedLog simplifies the management of person-based information for your wedding by offering dedicated lists for both guests and vendors. 

At the top of each list, you'll find a number indicating the total entries for that list. This real-time count ensures you stay informed about the current size of your guest and vendor lists.

To navigate through your extensive lists, a user-friendly scroll bar is provided.

<pic src="images/understanding-interface/lists.png" alt="Screenshot of the guest and vendor lists"></pic>

<br />

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3.2.1. Guest list

The guest list allows you to meticulously manage and track all information related to your guests. 

<pic src="images/understanding-interface/guest-card.png" alt="Screenshot of a guest card" width="500"></pic>

Individualized guest cards present comprehensive details, including tags, dietary requirements, RSVP status, phone numbers, addresses, emails, and assigned table numbers. This organized representation ensures that each guest's information is easily accessible and manageable.

#### 3.2.2. Vendor list

Similar to the guest list, the vendor list serves as a dedicated space for managing the vendors you are liaising with. 

<pic src="images/understanding-interface/vendor-card.png" alt="Screenshot of a vendor card" width="500"></pic>

Vendor cards encapsulate key information such as tags, phone numbers, addresses, and emails, providing you with a comprehensive snapshot of each vendor's essential details.

<br />

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3. Quick View Panel

The Quick View panel allows you to see an overview of your guests at a glance. It is located on the left side of the window.

<img src="images/understanding-interface/quick-view-panel.png" alt="WedLog's Quick View panel" height="350"></img>

The Quick View panel consists of 2 sections: the RSVP Status panel and the Dietary Requirements panel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.3.1. RSVP Status panel

The RSVP Status panel is designed to help you keep track of the proportion of RSVP statuses of your guests. The data is
represented using a pie chart, with labels indicating the number of guests with each RSVP status. The pie chart is updated automatically
whenever you add, delete or edit a guest.

<img src="images/understanding-interface/rsvp-status-panel.png" alt="RSVP Status panel" width="300" height="150"></img>

The pie chart slices are colour-coded as follows:
- `Yes`: Green
- `No`: Red
- `Unknown`: Orange

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3.3.2. Dietary Requirements panel

The Dietary Requirements panel is designed to help you keep track of your guests' dietary requirements. Whenever you specify
a guest to have certain dietary requirements, the requirements will be added to the panel alongside the total number
of guests with the same requirements.

This panel consolidates your guests' dietary requirements to be displayed together,
for you to consider when planning the menu for your wedding. The panel is also updated automatically whenever you add, delete or edit a guest.

<img src="images/understanding-interface/dietary-requirements-panel.png" alt="Dietary Requirements panel"></img>

<box type="tip">

- **The panel only displays dietary requirements for guests with RSVP status `yes`.** This is because guests with RSVP status `no` or `unknown` are not expected to attend the wedding, and hence do not need to have their dietary requirements taken into account.
- If a guest has no specified dietary requirements, we will consider the guest to have `regular` dietary requirements.
- Dietary requirements are displayed in descending order of the number of guests with the same requirements.

## 4. WedLog Tutorial

Welcome to the WedLog Tutorial! In this section, we'll guide you through the basic commands of WedLog to get you started on your wedding planning journey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1. Clearing guests and vendors

When you first open WedLog, the app contains some sample data. Let's reset the app using the `clear` command.

Type `clear` into the command box and press the `Enter` key. This will delete all the data from both the guest and vendor lists, so that you have a clean slate to work with.

Your app should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/clear.png" alt="Screenshot after clear command"></pic>

<br />

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2. Adding a guest

Let's add your first guest to WedLog with the `guest add` command. Every guest must have a name, and you have the option to include additional details such as a phone number, address, email, and table number. Furthermore, a guest can be associated with multiple tags.

To add a guest named `John Doe` with the details provided, type the following command and press `Enter`:
 
`guest add n/John Doe p/91234567 a/15 Sunville Road e/john@example.com tn/1 t/university t/friends`

Congratulations! You have successfully added your first guest to your guest list. Your app should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/guest-add.png" alt="Screenshot after guest add command"></pic>

<box type="tip">

Notice how the default RSVP status for a guest is `unknown`. We'll learn how to update this in the next section.

</box>

<br />

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.3. Editing a guest

Let's make adjustments to the details of a guest with the `guest edit` command. Suppose John Doe has responded to your invite and confirms that he will be attending your wedding. To reflect this, we'll update the RSVP status for John Doe to `yes`.

Type the following command and press `Enter`:

`guest edit 1 r/yes`

Your app should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/guest-edit.png" alt="Screenshot after guest edit command"></pic>

<box type="tip">

Notice that when a guest confirms their attendance at your wedding, their dietary requirement is automatically included in the dietary requirements panel. In the case of John Doe, since we have not specified any dietary requirements for him, his meal is recorded as the default `regular`.

This ensures that the tallies on the dietary requirements panel reflect only guests who are confirmed to be attending your wedding.

</box>

<br />

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.4. Filtering guests

Let's narrow down the guest list based on specific criteria using the `guest filter` command.

Before we can begin filtering our guests, we must add more guests to the list. Enter each of the following lines one-by-one into WedLog. Each line will add a new guest to the guest list.

`guest add n/Mary Fowl t/friends` <br>
`guest add n/Bob White` <br>
`guest add t/friends t/university n/Lily Mae` <br>

<box type="tip">

Notice that parameters can be placed in any order. (e.g. Lily Mae's name is specified after the tags)

</box>

Your app should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/guest-filter-0.png" alt="Screenshot after adding guests"></pic>

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Now that we have a few guests on our list, let's begin filtering.

First, let's filter for all guests who are friends. The following command will result in a list that contains only guests with the tag `friends`.

`guest filter t/friends`

Your guest list should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/guest-filter-1.png" alt="Screenshot after guest filter t/friends" width="300"></pic>

<box type="tip">

Notice that the number of guests stated at the top of the guest list has changed from 4 to 3, since only 3 guests are displayed in the result of the latest filter command.

</box>

Next, let's narrow down our search to filter for all guests who are friends from university. The following command will result in a list that contains only guests with the tags `friends` and `university`.

`guest filter t/friends t/university`

Your guest list should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/guest-filter-2.png" alt="Screenshot after guest filter t/friends t/university" width="300"></pic>

<box type="tip">

Notice that Mary Fowl is no longer included on this list, since she does not have the `university` tag.

</box>

> [Back to top](#user-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Finally, let's filter for all guests who have not been assigned to any table yet. We can use the empty `tn/` label to look for guests without any table numbers associated to them.

`guest filter tn/`

Your guest list should now look like this:

<pic src="images/tutorial/guest-filter-3.png" alt="Screenshot after guest filter tn/" width="300"></pic>

<box type="tip">

Notice that John Doe is not included on this list, since we have previously assigned him to table 1 when we first added him to the guest list.

</box>

<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.5. What's next?

Congratulations! You've completed the essential steps of the WedLog Tutorial, setting the stage for seamless and organized wedding planning. Armed with the knowledge of adding guests, editing details, and filtering, you're well-equipped to make the most of WedLog. 

You can manage your vendors with the same set of commands as guests by replacing the `guest` keyword with `vendor`. The only distinction is that vendors require fewer fields for quick and efficient management.

Feel free to explore each command in detail in the [features](#5-features) section of this guide. For a quick recap on the commands we've just learnt, check out the [command summary](#9-command-summary).

Happy planning, and may your wedding be everything you've dreamed of!

## 5. Features

### Understanding the parameter format

WedLog employs a standardized parameter format to ensure consistency and accuracy when inputting information. Parameters include names, phone numbers, and other guest or vendor details you wish to track.
Let's breakdown an example parameter `x/ABC` below.

| Guideline                                                                                                  | Example                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Each parameter takes the form `x/ABC`, where `x/` represents the label and `ABC` is the placeholder value. | `n/NAME` is the name parameter, where `n/` is the label and `NAME` is the placeholder value.        |
| Labels should be used in the exact format described in this guide.                                         | `n/` must be typed as `n/`. Variations such as `N/` or `name/` are invalid.                         |
| Placeholder values can be replaced with your own information.                                              | In `guest add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a placeholder which can be replaced, as in `guest add n/Gina Gan`. |

<br />

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Understanding the command format

Mastering the command format in WedLog is essential for efficient interaction. WedLog's commands allow for flexibility in parameter order and support optional and repeatable elements.

For illustration purposes, let's take a look at the command format for the `guest add` command:

`guest add n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/RSVP_STATUS] [tn/TABLE_NUMBER] [d/DIETARY_REQUIREMENT]… [t/TAG]…`

Let's break down the command guidelines in the table below:

| Guideline                                                                                                          | Example                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Parameters in square brackets are optional.                                                                        | `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Gina Gan t/friend` or as `n/Gina Gan`.         |
| Parameters with `…` after them can be used multiple times.                                                         | `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, or `t/friend t/family`. |
| Parameters can be in any order.                                                                                    | If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.   |
| Extra input for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `guest list`, `undo` and `exit`) will be ignored. | If you input `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.                        |

<box type="warning">

If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### 5.1 Add Command

#### 5.1.1. Adding a guest: `guest add`

Allows you to add a guest to WedLog, keeping track of important details such as their RSVP status, dietary requirements, and more.

Format: `guest add n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/RSVP_STATUS] [tn/TABLE_NUMBER] [d/DIETARY_REQUIREMENT]… [t/TAG]…`

<box type="info">

Refer to the [Appendix](#10-appendix-acceptable-values-for-parameters) for details on the acceptable values for the parameters.

</box>

<box type="warning">

A guest cannot share the same name as another guest. Names are matched on a case-insensitive basis (e.g. `gia` and `Gia` will be detected as a duplicate name).

</box>

<box type="tip">

A guest and vendor can share the same name (e.g. Even if there is a vendor named `Gia`, you are still able to add a guest named `Gia`).

</box>

Examples:
- `guest add n/Gina p/91234567 a/Blk 123 r/no`: Adds a guest named `Gina` with phone number `91234567`, address `Blk 123`, 
and RSVP status of `no`.
- `guest add n/Gerald d/ r/`: Adds a guest named `Gerald` with no dietary requirements and unknown RSVP status.
- `guest add n/Georgiana Tan t/family t/bridesmaid`: Adds a guest named `Georgiana` with two tags, `family` and `bridesmaid`.

Expected behaviour upon success:
- Adds the guest.
- Displays a message showing the added guest.

Expected behaviour upon failure:
- Not providing the `NAME` parameter: Displays in the error message “Invalid command format!” followed by instruction on `guest add` usage.
- Adding a new guest with the same `NAME` as an existing guest: Displays the error message "This guest already exists in WedLog." 
- Providing invalid values for parameters with input restrictions will also trigger error messages.

<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 5.1.2. Adding a vendor: `vendor add`

Allows you to add a vendor to WedLog, so that you can streamline coordination with the people involved in making your dream wedding a reality.

Format: `vendor add n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…`

<box type="info">

Refer to the [Appendix](#10-appendix-acceptable-values-for-parameters) for details on the acceptable values for the parameters.

</box>

<box type="warning">

A vendor cannot share the same name as another vendor. Names are matched on a case-insensitive basis (e.g. `valerie` and `Valerie` will be detected as a duplicate name).

</box>

<box type="tip">

A person can be recorded as both a guest and vendor. (e.g. Even if there is a guest named `Gia`, you are also able to add a vendor named `Gia`)

</box>

Examples:
- `vendor add n/Valerie Tan p/91234567 a/12 Buona Vista St`: Adds a vendor named `Valerie Tan` with phone number `91234567`
and address `12 Buona Vista St`.
- `vendor add n/Victor Wong e/victorwflowers@email.com t/florist t/photographer`: Adds a vendor named `Victor Wong` with
the email `victorwflowers@email.com` and the tags `florist` and `photographer`. 

Expected behaviour upon success:
- Adds a vendor to the vendor list.

## 6. FAQ
<!--@@author p-xp-reused from https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#faq-->

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install WedLog on the other computer and replace the data file it creates with your existing data file. This data file
can be located in your existing WedLog home folder.

<br />

**Q**: Is there somewhere I can refer to all the commands at one glance?<br>
**A**: You may refer to our [command summary](#9-command-summary) section for a quick overview of all the commands available in WedLog.

<br />

**Q**: I accidentally deleted my data file. How can I recover my lost data?<br>
**A**: Please try looking for the deleted file in your computer's recycle bin. Once located, simply move the file from the recycle bin into the same folder as the `wedlog.jar` file. 
Unfortunately, in the event that you cannot locate the deleted file in your recycle bin, we are 
unable to help you recover your lost data.

<br />

**Q**: Can I use WedLog without an internet connection?<br>
**A**: Yes, the WedLog application does not require internet connection to run.

<br />

**Q**: My wedding is over. How can I remove WedLog from my computer?<br>
**A**: We hope you had a good wedding planning journey with WedLog! If you placed WedLog inside a dedicated folder during the installation process,
simply delete the entire folder. Otherwise, you will have to find and delete the following files individually: `wedlog.jar`, `addressbook.log.0`, `preferences.json`, `config.json`, alongside the `data` folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Future Implementations

1. `guest clear` and `vendor clear` features will be implemented in the future. This feature will allow users to clear the guest list or vendor list quickly.
