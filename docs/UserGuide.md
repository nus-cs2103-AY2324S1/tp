## Features

* For a quick glance at all the commands and features, please refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `edit INDEX /n NAME`, `INDEX` and `NAME` are parameters that can be used as `edit 3 /n John Doe`.

* Commands, prefixes and most parameters are to be entered in lowercase. You can only enter capitalized letters for parameters of `NAME`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS`.<br>

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `/n NAME [/p PHONE]` can be used as `/n John Doe /p 98988989` or as `/n John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/n NAME /p PHONE`, `/p PHONE /n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div>

  <br>![result for incorrect edit command](images/incorrectEditCommand.png)
* If you did not specify any field to edit, the app should display the following message.
  <br>![result for no field to edit](images/noFieldToEdit.png)
* If you try to edit the field without any change, i.e., the existing field is exactly the same as the one you want to change into, the app should display the following message.

### Deleting an employee: `delete`

**What it does**

This feature allows users to delete an employee based on index or name.

**Command Format**

`delete INDEX` or `delete /n NAME`


* Deletes the employee at the specified `INDEX` or with the name `NAME`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div>

* The `NAME` must be in the correct [format](#parameter-formats).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
To allow greater flexibility in terms of searching, if there are 2 or more employees with same name, i.e. Amy Tan and Amy Teo, entering the command <code>delete /n FULLNAME</code> of any of the employee will still return a list of these employees instead of deleting the employee that matches the full name. 
</div>

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd employee in the employee directory.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st employee in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete /n Betsy` will delete the employee with the name 'Betsy' if there is only one such employee with this name. If there is no such employee, there will be an error message displayed. Otherwise, it will return you a list of employees with the name 'Betsy' and you will have to follow up with a `delete INDEX` command to delete the 'Betsy' that you want using the index displayed in the list.

**Output:**
* If the index is valid or there is only one employee in the list, whose name contains the keyword, ManaGease should display a confirmation message indicating that the employee information has been successfully deleted.
* The employee's list should be updated by removing the employee.
  <br>![result for deleting employee](images/deleteSuccess.png)

**Possible Error Output:**
* If there are multiple employees with the same name, all the matching employees would be displayed. Hence, ManaGease will return “Here is the list of the matching employees:”
