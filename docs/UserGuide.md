## Introduction
Flashlingo is a versatile desktop application centered around learning words through flash cards. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI),
while also providing the advantages of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI). Tailored with a focus on **beginner language
learners** with beginner level of proficiency in command line, Flashlingo specializes in expanding vocabulary. If you are not familiar with the command line interface (CLI), you can refer to the [**Glossary**](#glossary) section below,
and the [**Command Summary**](#command-summary) section for a quick overview of the commands.


By incorporating [**Leitner system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system#), Flashlingo schedules review sessions, ensuring words are revisited at
optimal intervals to enhance long-term memory retention. This method assists users in effectively retaining and expanding their vocabulary over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Application Features
Flashlingo predominantly consists of two main features: **Managing flash cards** and **Reviewing flash cards**
- **Managing flash cards**
  - Users are given the ability to add, delete and edit flash cards. And each flash card is assigned with a `level`, which
  indicates the proficiency of the user with the word. The level of the flash card will be updated after each review session.
* **Reviewing flash cards**
   - In each review session, words that require reviewing will be presented to users one by one. For each word, users can indicate whether they have
     - memorized the word
     <br>
     This will advance the word into the next `level`, meaning less frequent review for the word in the near future.
     - forgotten the word
     <br>
      This will decrease the `level` by 1, meaning more frequent review for the word in the near future.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the level:**<br>

* The higher the `Level` is, the higher the proficiency of the user with the word is. The maximum level is 5, and it will be displayed as `word mastered`.

* Words which are indicated as `word mastered` will not appear in review session.

</div>

With each review frequency scientifically determined by **Flashlingo**, it will make your vocabulary learning an absolute breeze,
meaning you can **spend less time and memorize things more enduringly.**


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest `flashlingo.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Flashlingo.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar flashlingo.jar` command to run the application.
   Below shows the steps to perform such a task
    1. Open up the terminal.
    * For mac users, press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight search, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`.
      ![img.png](images/Terminal.png)
    * For windows users, press `Windows + R`, type `cmd` and press `Enter`.
    2. Navigate to the folder containing the jar file. In this example, it is in the Downloads folder. So the command is:
        ```
        cd Downloads
        ```
       >Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) for more information on how to navigate to a folder in the terminal.
    3. Simply type in `java -jar flashlingo.jar` to get started!

### Adding a flash card: `add`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about adding words:**
* In order to give users full customizability, there's no any restriction on input, as long as it is not empty.

</div>

Adds a word to the flash card with its translation.
* Creates a wild flash card.
* Works to add a word with its translation in their respective languages.
* The already saved translation can be overridden with a new translation in a different language.

[Command Format](#commands): `add w/<WORD> t/<TRANSLATION> [wl/<WORD_LANGUAGE>] [tl/<TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE>]`
> The default language for both word and translation is blank (`""`)

Examples:
* `add w/雪 t/snow` saves the translation of **雪** as **snow**
* `add w/雪 wl/Chinese t/snow tl/English` saves the translation of the **Chinese** word **雪** as an **English** word **snow**

* Users can add two flash cards with the **same word and translation BUT in different language**<br>
  The following three commands will not cause duplicate error:
    * `add w/雪 t/snow`
    * `add w/雪 t/snow wl/Chinese tl/English`
    * `add w/雪 t/snow wl/Japanese tl/English`
* Users are **not allowed** to add a flash card with the **same word and translation**<br>
  The following command will cause duplicate error:
    * `add w/sorry t/sorry`
    * `add w/sorry t/SORRY`
* Users are **not allowed** to add a flash card with the **empty word or translation**<br>


### Deleting a flash card: `delete`

Deletes a flash card and its related information
* Deletes a flash card.

[Command Format](#commands): `delete <INDEX>`

Examples:
* `delete 2` deletes the word and its translation at index 2

Output:

|  Before edit   |![img.png](images/BeforeEdit.png)  |
|:--------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| **After edit** | ![img.png](images/AfterEdit.png)  |

**Note**
* `<INDEX>` is the index of each flash card in the `list`
* Users must change at **LEAST** one certain parameter by using certain prefix
    * Word: `w/WORD`
    * Word Language: `wl/WORD_LANGUAGE`
    * Translation: `t/TRANSLATION`
    * Translation Language: `tl/TRANSLATION_LANGUAGE`

Output:

![img.png](images/ListCommand.png)


**Note**
* `list` command cannot be used during a review session
   * To facilitate learning, only the flash cards - that are to be reviewed - can be seen during the review session.
   * As soon as the review session ends, all the flash cards can be listed once again.

### Finding a flash card: `find`

Filters the flash card list by the given keywords. All the flash cards whose word or translation contains at least one of the keywords will be displayed.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `food` will match `Food`

[Command Format](#commands): `find <KEYWORDS...>`

Examples:
* `find food` returns the flash card list and its translation that contains the keyword `food`
* `find oo` returns the flash card list and its translation that contains the substring `oo`

## FAQ

**Q: How can I check if I have installed and am using the Java `11` version?**<br>
* Open up the terminal. **Run the `java -version` command.** The output should contain similar information to:
`version "11.0.X"`.
* If Java `11` is not installed, you may download it again.
* If you are using lower or higher versions of Java, you may find switch version on [Mac](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21964709/how-to-set-or-change-the-default-java-jdk-version-on-macos), [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26993101/switching-between-different-jdk-versions-in-windows) or [Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/740757/switch-between-multiple-java-versions) useful.


**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**<br>
<br>
Install the app on the other computer and **overwrite the empty data file** it creates with the **file that contains the data of your previous Flashlingo** home folder.

**Q: How can I import my data to the app?**<br>
<br>
Save your words and translations in the specified format in an Excel file. Move the file to the same folder with `flashlingo.jar`.
Then, **use the `load` command to import the data.**

**Q: What may be the reasons why my data cannot be loaded into the app?**<br>

* First, **check your file name** by opening the located folder. The file name should be directly displayed. Also, you can right-click the file to view the file name in its detailed info.
* If Flashlingo still cannot read the file, try inputting the file name with and without the extension `.xlsx` in the `load` command. This may solve potential issues with file name loading within different systems.
* Secondly, ensure the **content in your file is correctly formatted and valid**. All rules can be found [here](#load).
* There may be issues with loading Excel if you have tried to delete data without using the _delete whole row/column_ function. Copy the entire data (only valid rows and columns) to a new Excel file and try again.

**Q: After I reviewed a flash card, I edited details of the card by the `edit` command. Will I be able to see these changes immediately reflected in the review session?**<br>

* Unfortunately, **no**. The card is updated synchronously in the card list and the review session of Flashlingo. However, since you have already reviewed the same card on the day, the card will not be included in the review session again.
* To check the card after editing, you can **use the `list` or `find` command** to locate the specific card. The changes will also be reflected in the next review session for that card.

**Q: If the displayed level of a flash card is `Word Mastered`, what can I do if I want to review the card again?**<br>

* Currently, there's no way for you to manually change the level of a flash card. Flashlingo is designed to automatically remove words that learners are familiar with from the review session.
* However, if you must review the card again, you can first use the `delete` command to delete the card and then use the `add` command to re-add the same card. The new card will be reset to level 1 and added to the review session.

| **CLI**            | A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system. You can check the tutorial [**here**](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html).                            |
| **GUI**            | A graphical user interface (GUI) is a digital interface in which a user interacts with graphical components such as icons, buttons, and menus.                                                                                                                                  |
| **JSON**           | JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format commonly used for representing structured data.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Leitner System** | The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in 1972. It is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition, where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals. |
| **Level**          | The level represents the proficiency with a specific flash card. The higher the `Level` is, the higher the proficiency of the user with the word is.                                                                                                                            |
| **Review Session** | A review session is a designated phase within the system where words requiring review are presented individually, based on Leitner System. Users can confirm their understanding or signal a need for further review.                                                           |
