# Class Manager 2023 User Guide

Class Manager 2023 (CM 23) is a **desktop app for managing your students' contacts in the class,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CM 23 can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ClassManager.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ClassManager.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar classmanager.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img alt="Ui" src="images/Ui.png" width="600">

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all student details.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com s/A0245234A c/T11` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the Class Manager.

   * `delete s/A0245234A` : Deletes the student with student number A0245234A, which is added in the previous step.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Commands](#commands) below for details of each command.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME c/CLASS_NUMBER`, `c/CLASS_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

### Student Number

* Student Number refers to the unique matriculation number of a NUS student. It must begin with capital A, followed by any number of alphanumeric characters. It must not be blank.
* Class Manager uses the Student Number to uniquely identify each student in most commands. The Student Number is not case-sensitive, other than the first capital A. e.g. If the Student Number is `A123V`, `A123v` also refers to the same student.

### Command navigation

* Class Manager allows you to navigate to previously entered commands using the arrow keys. Navigate to earlier commands using the up arrow key, and later commands using the down arrow key.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Class Manager 2023 home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
