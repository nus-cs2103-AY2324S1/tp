## Introduction

#### ***Revolutionise your studying experience with <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>!***

Welcome to the user guide for <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>, your ultimate companion in mastering the
Computer Science curriculum at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This guide is designed to provide you with a
comprehensive understanding of the app and how to leverage its powerful features for your academic success.

#### What is <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>?

<span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> is not just another study app; it's a game-changer in the world of education.
Tailored specifically for NUS Computer Science students, this **desktop application** enables incredibly easy creation
of flashcards for revision. It employs the efficacy of [active recall](#definitions) when you practise with the
[flashcards](#definitions) you made to increase memory retention. Say goodbye to time-consuming note-taking,
and say hello to a more efficient, effective, and enjoyable study experience.

Made with the intention to maximise your study experience, here are some features we believe you'll love:
1. **Enhanced Memory Retention:** Thanks to <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>'s inbuilt [spaced repetition](#definitions) system, you can
supercharge your memory and recall the important details needed. The app optimizes when you should review your
flashcards, ensuring you remember and grasp complex concepts with ease.
2. **Intuitive Card Categorisation:** <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> helps you categorize your flashcards based on subject. This feature
makes it a breeze to organize and access specific topics, keeping your study sessions focused and productive.

*... and many more!*

#### Prerequisites

Before you get started with <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>, here's what we recommend you need to make
full use of the app:

- **Comfortable with English**: Since <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> is an English-based app, a basic
understanding of the language will ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.
- **Typing Proficiency**: <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> primarily uses a
[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#definitions) on top of a [Graphic User Interface (GUI)](#definitions). This means that
most of the interaction with <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> is through the use of [keystrokes](#definitions).
Being comfortable and efficient at typing will help you make the most of the app and enhance your user experience.

| The order of prefix does not matter.                                                   | Prefix can be reordered without having any effect on the command.                                                                                                             | `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER` and `add a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` are both valid inputs that generates the same card.                       |
| Commands that do not take in any parameters will disregard extraneous parameters.      | Certain commands such as `help`, `clear`, `exit`, `random` and `list` (in certain cases: see [list](#view-all-flashcards--list)) will disregard any inputs after the command. | `help 123 ` or `clear a/abc` will be regarded as `help` and `clear` respectively.                                                 |

their locations.

![gui_overview](./images/UserGuide/1.4_ui_overview.png)

Here is a summary of what each component in the GUI displays.

| Name of component | Description                                                                                                                                                |

### Tutorial

This is a tutorial for **first-time** and **beginner** <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> users. For more advanced users,
feel free to explore the other features in the [command summary](#command-summary) instead. In this tutorial, we will explain how to
*add, edit, tag, and practise* your flashcards.

1. Launch <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>.
   - Refer to the instructions [here](#installation) if you are unsure how to launch
   <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span>.
   <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
      ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that users who are launching <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> for the first time will have an empty deck.
   </div>


2. First, let's try to add your very first flashcard. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`add q/what does + mean in boolean algebra? a/it means OR.`

    ![adding a card](./images/UserGuide/1.4_tutorial_add.png)

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    <br>

3. Congratulations, you have created your first flashcard! Now, let's try to edit the card created from the
previous input by capitalising it! Note that the flashcard just created is at index `1`. Type the following command
and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>`edit 1 q/What does + mean in boolean algebra? a/It means OR.`


4. Next, let's tag it under the module CS1231S. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>:
<br>`edit 1 t/CS1231S`


5. Let's add another flashcard. Type the following command and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`add q/What are the different hazards to consider when using pipelining? a/Structural, Data and Control t/CS2100`


6. Feel free to add a few more cards by following steps 1 to 4!


7. Next, to practise the first card, do: <br> `practise`


8. Try to recall the answer, and when you are ready to reveal the answer, type the following command and hit
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>`solve`


9. How hard was the answer to recall? Set the difficulty of the flashcard by typing any of the following command and hit
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <br>
`set d/easy`<br>
`set d/medium`<br>
`set d/hard`


10. The flashcard will automatically be reinserted into deck. This is based on how difficult you found the question
to be. With our inbuilt [spaced repetition](#glossary) system, as you practise, flashcards you find more difficult will
surface more at the top.


11. Note that the `practise`, `solve`, and `set` commands support indexes, but we recommended to use them without
indexes as shown in this tutorial. This is to optimise the effectiveness of the [spaced repetition](#glossary) by
testing your memory with the most difficult flashcard.


12. Get familiar with these commands and when you are ready, move on to the other commands listed [here](#command-summary).

## Importing and Exporting Decks

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

‚ÑπÔ∏è  **To Note:**<br>

The import and export functions are meant to be used before and after revision respectively <br>

They are not to be confused as commands input by user, but rather as a method to transfer and import data easily <br>

</div>

Users can share their own Decks with others or download their Decks to their own.
Both import and export features reside in the **File** menu.

### Export
Users can share their own Deck by clicking on the `Export` button. Their own Deck
will be displayed as a JSON file which can be easily copied either through the `Copy Data`
button provided or other means.

### Import
Users can enjoy the Decks of others by clicking on the `Import` button. A text field
is displayed for users to paste in the JSON file containing the decks of others. The
app will close upon clicking the `Import Data` button. Users will have to rerun the app
to see their new decks.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

   All data is saved as a JSON file at this specified path: [JAR file location]/data/deck.json. <br>
   It is **NOT** recommended for users to modify data directly as it can cause the app to malfunction. <br>
   If you still wish to proceed with modifying the data directly, <span style="color: green;">lesSON</span> would not be held accountable of the risks of such actions.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Check version of Java installed

**Q:** How do I check my version of Java I have installed on my computer? <br>
**A:** Open up a command prompt and type `java -version` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Shortcut to open the command prompt:
- For Windows: Press <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and enter `cmd`.
- For macOS: Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> and enter `Terminal`.

### App not showing

**Q:** The application is running fine, but I am unable to see the [GUI](#definitions). What should I do? <br>
**A:** This is a currently [known issue](#known-issues) with a temporary hotfix. We are working on a solution.

[Go to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. Users can create **duplicate** tags for the same flashcard. We plan to enforce uniqueness of tags for a
flashcard in future enhancements. Until then, please do take caution to avoid adding duplicate tags for the same
flashcard. 


2. The app **may not show** for users with multiple displays. If you relocate the app to a secondary display and
subsequently cease using the secondary display, the app will continue to run but will no longer be visible on your
primary display. Closing the app and re-running it will not solve the issue. We are working on a solution but until then,
we recommend relocating the app back to your main display before disconnecting your secondary display.

If you encountered any other bugs or errors, do let us know with the relevant details (e.g. screenshots) via our
official channels found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w17-4.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html).
