<img src='images/ug/labelledUi.png' width='600'>

1. Command Bar
2. Console
3. Patient List Panel
4. Patient Record Panel

<br>

#### Command Bar

This is where you type in commands for the program to run. Refer to the [Features](#features) or
[Command Summary](#command-summary) section for the command inputs accepted by the app.

To begin typing, simply select the command bar by clicking the space that says “Enter command here…”. Then, type in
your command and hit Enter to execute the command!

<img src='images/ug/commandBar.png' width='500'>

<br>

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Console

This is where status messages are displayed. Status messages are displayed depending on the user input
in the command box.

Status messages provide you with feedback such as:
+ What a command does and its format
+ Why a command input is invalid
+ Whether a command is successful

<img src='images/ug/console.png' width='500'>
<br>

<br>

#### Patient List Panel

This is where the list of patients is displayed. It displays either the complete list of all patients in the system
(after `list` command), a filtered list of patients (after `find` command), or a single patient card
(after `view` command).

Patients are listed out vertically. You can scroll through the list using the scrollbar on the right side, your mouse’s
scroll wheel, or your trackpad. To select a patient in the list, simply click on their patient card. The selected
patient is indicated by the light blue border around their patient card.

<img src='images/ug/patientList.png' width='300'>
<br>

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each patient is represented by a patient card in the list. Here is an overview of the information displayed in a
patient card.

<img src='images/ug/patientListCard.png' width='450'>
<br>

1. Full Name
2. Age
3. Gender
4. Birthday
5. Phone Number

   <img src='images/ug/prHigh.png' height='20'>
9. IC Number

<br>

#### Patient Record Panel

This is where the details and record of the selected patient in the list is displayed. It displays all the details of a
patient and all their patient record information, except for their age. The labels below the patient’s name indicate the
patient’s priority level and tags respectively. If there is no selected patient in the list, the panel will be blank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<box type="info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g `n/NAME [pr/PRIORITY]` can be used as `n/John Doe pr/HIGH` or as `n/John Doe`

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as ` `(i.e. 0 times), `t/critical`, `t/critical t/bedrest` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Except for `n/NAME`, all parameters are case-insensitive. e.g. `n/john doe` is different from `n/John Doe`, but
  `i/t1234567a` is the same as `i/T1234567A`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo`, `redo`, and
  `clear`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Prefix Summary

For some commands in the subsequent sections, you might come across parameters specified with a prefix
(e.g. prefix `n/` with parameter `NAME` in `n/NAME`). These parameters refer to patient attributes or record fields that are
accepted by the command. Certain parameters have constraints and can only take on certain values. The table below
provides a summary of all prefixes.

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the
   primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the preferences.json file created by the
   application before running the application again.

2. Age is not displayed in the Patient Record Panel of UI.

3. The UI of the app might appear ‘squashed’ upon launch i.e. not all details can be visible. To avoid this, we advise
   users to use our application in full screen.

4. The use of extra and invalid prefixes/parameters will not be detected properly, resulting in the wrong error message
   being displayed.

5. Long tags cannot be displayed properly in the app and might overlap with other details of the patient in the patient
   card. As such, we advise against the use of long tags.

6. Some invalid birthdays can be added/edited to a patient e.g. 30 February.

7. For the `view` command, users will have to click on the patient card themselves in order to see the patient’s details
   and record.

8. The minimize button for the help window might not work for some users.

9. Currently, any alphabets are accepted for the start of an IC number. Ideally, only letters "S", "T", "F", "G" or "M"
   are accepted for the start of an IC number.
