# TutorMate User Guide
<br>

## About

TutorMate is a desktop app targeted to private tuition teachers on handling tuition related matters.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (_CLI_ <sup>[1](#glossary)</sup>) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (_GUI_ <sup>[2](#glossary)</sup>).
If you can type fast, TutorMate can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional _GUI_ <sup>[2](#glossary)</sup> apps.

This document describes the main features of TutorMate:
1. Student Management System: track all student details
2. Lesson Schedule: easily plan and manage lessons
3. Task Lists: keep track of tasks to be done for lessons

With a customised student list and schedule in TutorMate just for you, organising lessons and managing students
will be the least of your worries. 

Users are expected to have a basic level of technical knowledge and are familiar with fundamental computer operations and tasks e.g. how to open command terminal and install application.

This project is based on the [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://se-education.org).

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have _Java_ <sup>[3](#glossary)</sup>  11 or above installed in your Computer. You can check by opening a _command terminal_ <sup>[4](#glossary)</sup> and typing `java -version`.

2. Download the latest `tutormate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/releases/latest).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ <sup>[5](#glossary)</sup> for your TutorMate.

4. Open a _command terminal_ <sup>[4](#glossary)</sup>, navigate into the _home folder_ <sup>[5](#glossary)</sup> using the change directory command `cd`, and use the `java -jar tutormate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A _GUI_ <sup>[2](#glossary)</sup> similar to the picture below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

![Ui](images/about.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list students` : Lists all students with their name.

    * In üë®‚Äçüéì ___STUDENTS list___:

        * `add -name Leah` : Adds a student named "Leah" to the application.

        * `show 3` : Shows the details of the person with the index 3 in TutorMate.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.
7. Refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) below for the summary of all commands.
8. Refer to the [Glossary](#glossary) below for definitions of glossary terms.

## Important Notes

### Basic Usage

<!-- todo, illustrate -->
* The app is split into 3 states: üë®‚Äçüéì ___STUDENTS list___, üìÖ ___SCHEDULE list___ (default) and üíº ___TASKS list___. Each corresponds to the main features of TutorMate.
* Each state has its associated features, while certain features work with all states but has differing functionalities.
* The üë®‚Äçüéì ___STUDENTS list___ handles student details management, üìÖ ___SCHEDULE list___ handles lessons, scheduling and the tasks for each lesson while the full üíº ___TASKS list___ is a view to display all tasks.
* The _GUI_ <sup>[2](#glossary)</sup> has several main components (see _GUI_ <sup>[2](#glossary)</sup> image below):
    * The command box is for users to enter and execute commands.
    * The response box is to display responses for command execution, to indicate success or errors.
    * The left side has the list panel, which shows different list types (student, schedule, tasks).
    * The right side has the details panel, which shows details of any specific item in the list.

### Terminologies / Symbols
* Flag: A flag is a word starting with a dash "-" that is used to identify the type of information that is being provided e.g. `-name`.

* Text formatted as code snippets are either commands e.g. `list schedule`, command formats e.g. `list [LIST][KEYWORDS]` or parameters e.g. `NAME`.
* <box type="info" seamless>This box denotes additional information.</box>
* <box type="tip" seamless>This box denotes tips to improve usability.</box>
* <box type="warning" seamless>This box denotes warnings that can cause errors.</box>
```
This box denotes command outputs.

### Notes on Command Format
<box type="info" seamless>

* Words in upper case are compulsory parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -name NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add -name Leah`.
  In this case, "Leah" is substituted for `NAME`.
* Words in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `list [LIST] [KEYWORDS]` can be used as `list` or as `list students email`, though the behaviour may differ.
* Flags can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. both `link -student student name -lesson lesson name` and `link -lesson lesson name -student student name` are acceptable.
* Parameters without a flag need to strictly follow the order specified.<br>
  e.g. For delete command which specifies `delete INDEX`, the "index" parameter must immediately follow the command name "delete".<br>
* All command names are case-insensitive. <br>
  e.g. `linkTo` is the same as `linkto` or `LiNkTo`.
* When applicable, extraneous parameters and flags for commands will be ignored .<br>
  e.g. if the command entered is `add info -name new name -notValid flagBody -subject physics`, it will be interpreted as `add -name new name -subject physics`. "info " and "-notValid flagBody" will be ignored. <br>
  e.g. if the command entered is `delete 3 extra`, it will be interpreted as `delete 3`<br>
  e.g. However, `delete extra 3` will not be accepted as delete command specifies that the index parameter must immediately follow the command name.

### Other Notes
<box type="warning" seamless>

* Please avoid using " -" in the value of a parameter as TutorMate treats " -" as a reserved word that signifies the start of a new flag.
* Please do not abuse the parser of TutorMate. For example, do not game it with special characters, patterns or ___code injections___<sup>[6](#glossary)</sup>. TutorMate does not guarantee the behaviour of the application on deliberate and malicious abuse beyond supported normal usage.
* TutorMate supports a maximum of 99999 students, 99999 lessons and 99999 tasks. Further data beyond this limit might be lost and not accessible in the application.
* Please avoid manually modifying the data files in the _home folder_<sup>[5](#glossary)</sup>. Doing so may result in unexpected behaviour and data loss.
* Please avoid running multiple instances of TutorMate at the same time. Doing so may result in unexpected behaviour and data loss.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, please note that the scroll panels for the code outputs in the examples will not work. They are just a reference for the outputs that you will see on the application. The errors and solutions will be elaborated in the examples.

## Features

### List Feature

The list command is the way to navigate between the 3 states in our app.
It will display the specified list and its corresponding details panel.

Format: `list [LIST] [KEYWORDS]`
* Shows the list and associated detail panel for the specified `[LIST]`.
* The `[KEYWORDS]` parameter is for specifying which student details to display, and is only valid for üë®‚Äçüéì ___STUDENTS list___. Specifying the `[KEYWORDS]` parameter without specifying the `[LIST]` parameter is not allowed. When used for displaying the üìÖ ___SCHEDULE list___ and üíº ___TASKS list___, `[KEYWORDS]` will be ignored.
* Refer to the parameter constraints [here](#parameter-summary).

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
- `list` without specifying the `[LIST]` parameter defaults to showing the üìÖ ___SCHEDULE list___.
- Using the `[KEYWORDS]` parameter after `list` (without specifying `[LIST]`) is not allowed!

</box>

#### For Student:

Example usages:
* `list students` displays all the students with their names (including previously specified fields).
* `list students subjects email` displays all the students with their names, the list of subjects for each student and their email.

### Command History Feature

The command history feature allows you to retrieve previously typed commands into the command text box.

* To start navigating the command history, press the up <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚áß</kbd> or down <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚á©</kbd> arrow on your keyboard, which will point and return the most recent command text (for invalid commands, it will retrieve it again since it is also saved, hence it will not change the command text yet).
* Cycle through the command history using the up <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚áß</kbd> arrow to go back to previous commands, and down <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚á©</kbd> arrow to go to next commands, going beyond the command history will retrieve the oldest or newest command text for respectively.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
- Command history is only valid per session, it does not save into storage.
- Invalid commands are also saved into command history.
- During each successful command execution, the _pointer_<sup>[8](#glossary)</sup> resets again, hence pressing the up <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚áß</kbd> or down <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚á©</kbd> will point and return the most recent command text.
- Retrieved commands will replace the existing text in command box.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
* The index in command history remains when user clears the command box while scrolling through the history.
* e.g. For the history [`list tasks`, `list students`, `list schedule`], if user retrieves the command history with `list students` and clears his command box, pressing up <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚áß</kbd> again will retrieve `list tasks`.
  </box>

Example usages:
* Input: `list students`, `list schedule`, `list tasks` were entered in this order.
1. Pressing up <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚áß</kbd> arrow will go back in the command history and retrieve: `list tasks`.
2. Pressing up <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚áß</kbd> arrow will go further back in the command history and retrieve: `list schedule`.
3. Pressing down <kbd style="font-size: 20px;">‚á©</kbd> arrow will go forward in the command history and retrieve: `list tasks`.

### Saving Data

TutorMate data is saved in the _hard disk_<sup>[9](#glossary)</sup> automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
<br>
### Editing Data File

TutorMate data is saved automatically as _JSON_<sup>[10](#glossary)</sup> files `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`, `[JAR file location]/data/schedulelist.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/personLessonMap.json`. It is possible to update data directly by editing that data file, but we do not recommend doing so.
If you insist on modifying the data file directly, be very careful, especially when you modify attributes such as Start and End time of lessons, as any overlapping lesson timings will render the data as invalid. Scenarios like these are not exhaustive.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I install Java version 11? <br>
**A**: You can follow the steps [here](https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk) to install Java 11 to your computer.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? <br>
**A**: Copy TutorMate's jar file into the folder you want to use as the _home folder_<sup>[5](#glossary)</sup> in the other computer. Before running the application, copy _addressbook.json_, _personLessonMap.json_ and _schedulelist.json_ files from the _home folder_<sup>[5](#glossary)</sup> in your current computer into the _home folder_<sup>[5](#glossary)</sup> of the other computer. After copying the 3 files, running the application will show the same data. However, do note that the changes made through the application in one computer will not be reflected in the data in another computer.

**Q**: Can I edit the data in the application through the _addressbook.json, personLessonMap.json, schedulelist.json_ files directly? <br>
**A**: It is possible. However, it is not advisable for normal users to do so as if the changes made to the data file makes its format invalid, TutorMate will discard all data. Please use the `edit` command to make changes to your data instead. If you insist on directly modifying data files, please read this caution [here](#editing-data-file).

**Q**: Can I still use the application without internet connection? <br>
**A**: Yes, you can. TutorMate is an offline desktop application. The only exception is the `help` command which provides a _URL_<sup>[11](#glossary)</sup> to the user guide.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the _GUI_ <sup>[2](#glossary)</sup> will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
