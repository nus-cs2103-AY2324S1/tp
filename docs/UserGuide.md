## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ManageHR.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar ManageHR.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all employees.

   * `add n/John doe p/91234567 e/example@example.com a/1 Lower Kent Ridge Road s/4000 l/12 r/manager d/SoC HR` : Quickly add an employee:

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd employee shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all employees.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [d/Department]` can be used as `n/John Doe d/Investment` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[d/DEPARTMENTS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `d/Investment`, `d/Sales d/Logistic` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Feature 1: Manager-Subordinate Relationships

### Overview

Our application includes a powerful manager-subordinate feature that enables users to define and manage hierarchical
relationships within their organization. This feature is designed to streamline the management of employees between
supervisors and subordinates.

### Constraints

1. Only employees with `manager` role can be in charge of other employees.
2. Each employee must either be `manager` and `subordinate` but not both.
3. Both employees that are either `manager` or `subordinate` can have multiple `manager` in charge of them.
4. An employee could have no designated "manager" responsible for overseeing them.
5. A `manager` employee could not edit their `role` and `name` attribute when he or she is in charge of any subordinates.
6. Cyclical manager-subordinate relationship between `employee` objects who are `manager` is allowed.

### Usage Instructions

To set up manager-subordinate relationships, follow these steps:

#### Enrolling a New Employee with Manager-Subordinate Relationships

When enrolling a new employee in ManageHR, you can also establish manager-subordinate relationships. Follow these steps:
1. Include `r/ROLE` into `add` command, where `ROLE` could either be `manager` or `subordinate`. This is a compulsory field where each employee must either be `manager` or `subordinate`.
2. Include `m/MANAGER_NAME…` into `add` command. This is an optional field. Note that you can have multiple managers in charge of this employee or none at all.
3.  `m/MANAGER_NAME…` represents the managers who are currently in charge of the said employee.

#### Editing an Existing Employee with Manager-Subordinate Relationships
When editing an existing employee in ManageHR, you can also establish or modify manager-subordinate relationships. Follow these steps:
1. Include `r/ROLE` into `edit` command to change the current `role` of the employee.
    - The employee can only change his or her `role` from `manager` to `subordinate` only if he or she has no employees under his or her supervision.
    - The name of the employee can only be edited if he or she is a `manager` with no employees under his or her supervision.
2. Include `m/MANAGER_NAME…` into the `edit` command. This will place the employee to be under that `manager`.
    - The `MANAGER_NAME` stated must correspond with an existing employee with the same name and is also a `manager`.
3. `Employee` who are `manager` can edit their role to be `manager` again without violating any of the Manaer-Subordinate constraint
since their hierarchy level still remains constant.

#### Deleting an Existing Employee with Manager-Subordinate Relationships
When deleting an existing employee from ManageHR, you will need to account for the manager-subordinate relationships. Follow these steps:
1. The employee to be deleted must not be in charge of any employees.
    - If the employee to be deleted has employees under him, all the employees under said employee must be reassigned.

## Feature 2: Department-Employee Relationships

### Overview

Our application also includes a department-employee feature that enables users to group employees within
organization. This feature is designed to help users keep track of large clustering of employees.

### Constraints

1. A department can be empty, or contain single/multiple employees
2. An employee can be assigned to multiple departments
3. If an employee is in a department, a department will contain the employee
4. When an employee is removed from the system, all departments containing the employees will remove the employee from
   the system
5. When a department is removed from the system, all employees that were in that department will have that department
   property removed from them


### Usage Instructions

To use this function relationships, follow these steps:

#### Creating a department

Use the `department` command to add a department into the system. The department name must not already exist

#### Adding/Removing a employee from a department

Use the `add` or `edit` command with the department tag `d/` to include/remove an employee from a department

### Deleting a department

Use the `department` command to remove a department from the system. The department name must exist in the system

### Viewing help : `help`

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A:** To transfer your data to another computer, follow these steps:

1. Install the app on the other computer if you haven't already.

2. Locate the empty data file that the app creates on the new computer.

3. Replace the empty data file with the file containing the data from your previous ManageHR home folder.

Now, your data should be successfully transferred to the new computer.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
