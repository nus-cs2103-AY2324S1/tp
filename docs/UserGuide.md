UniCa$h **is a desktop application used for university students who want to be more financially conscious,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you can type fast, UniCa$h can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span">
Please read through sections [Installation](#installation) and [Command Breakdown](#command-breakdown) before approaching any command documentation
</div>

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `unicash.jar` from [GitHub](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-3/tp/releases/latest).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your UniCa$h.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar unicash.jar` command to
   run the application.

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type a command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will
   execute the `help` command and open the help window.

   To get started with UniCa$h, you can run the [`add_transaction` command](#add-transaction)!

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

### Command Breakdown

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
This section is important in understanding the constraints and components of a command. All constraints apply to all usages of these prefixes in the commands.
</div>

Commands in UniCa$h have the following structure:

<p style="text-align: center;">
`command_word (ARGUMENT) (PREFIXES)`
</p>

| command_word                                                                                                                                                                      | ARGUMENT                                                                                                      | PREFIXES                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Represents the command to run. May be referenced by alternative shorthands as described in each command section. All commands and their alternatives are always case-insensitive. | Comes before all prefixes and often used to reference an index within the transactions list<br>Often optional | Often referred to as "Parameters"<br>Commonly used to specify various attributes/properties for a given `command_word` |

#### Argument Types

| Argument              | Meaning                                  | Constraints                                                                                               | Remarks                                                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INDEX`<sup>1,2</sup> | Index of transaction in transaction list | Integer indices that must be `>= 1` (positive integer) and are one-indexed, i.e. start with `1`, not `0`. | Commonly used in edit and delete to reference transactions in a transaction list |

**Notes:**

1. `INDEX` uses positive integers which we define as integers that are strictly greater than `0`. 
2. UniCa$h divides the error handling for `INDEX` into two cases, invalid numbers (non-positive integers, i.e. `<= 0` values,
values larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or non-integer values e.g. `10.2`) are treated as invalid command formats while values that exceed the transaction list will be treated as being an invalid index as the supported values are `[1, transaction list size]`. 

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span">
For more clarity about how commands are parsed and why `INDEX` is parsed this way, please refer to our [developer guide](DeveloperGuide.html#delete-transaction) on how some commands like `delete_transaction` handles `INDEX`.
</div>

#### Prefixes

Prefixes are in the format: 

<p style="text-align: center;">
`prefix/Value`
</p>

Prefixes have several variations with different notations:

||Mandatory|Optional<sup>1</sup>|
||---------|--------|
|Not variadic|`prefix/Value`|`[prefix/Value]`|
|Variadic|`prefix/Value...`|`[prefix/Value]...`|

**Notes:**

1. Optional fields imply that the _omission_ of the field, not the absence of value when used, is supported. This means that `l/` is **_NOT_** an optional parameter, but rather a blank one.

#### Prefix Types

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The constraints for the prefixes used in UniCa$h are universal across all commands.
<br><br>
Note that each command might use the prefixes slightly differently so refer to each command's details for more information.

**Notes:**

1. Amounts can be exactly `$0.00` as users may want to simply track that a transaction is present but not specify the amount.
User might also want to track financial events not involving currency exchange, such as barter trading, free gifts, etc. 
2. Intervals work by filtering by the specified time period. 
   1. For `day` intervals, only transactions of the same day are found. 
   2. For `week` intervals, only transactions of the same [week of year](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/WeekFields.html#weekOfYear()) are found. 
   3. For `month` intervals, only transactions of the same month are found.


### User Interface (UI) Overview

When UniCa$h is first opened, it would look something like the image shown earlier 
near the top of the user guide. 

The UI components and features are elaborated explicitly in our Developer Guide
which can be found [here](#DeveloperGuide.md). However, for ease of reference of some key UI
terms used in this User Guide, the annotated image of the UniCa$h window is duplicated below.

#### Edit Transaction

Edits an existing transaction in UniCa$h.

Command: `edit_transaction INDEX [n/NAME] [type/TYPE] [amt/AMOUNT] [dt/DATETIME] [l/LOCATION] [c/CATEGORY]`

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
For more information about the prefix constraints, refer to the [command breakdown's prefix types section](#prefix-types)
</div>

Command Words Accepted: `edit_transaction`, `edit`, `et` (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
**Added Constraints**
<br><br>
Similar to the Add command, there is a limit of 5 `Category` that can be added to a `Transaction`. <br/>
</div>

Important notes:

1. The value of `INDEX` provided must be between 1 and the total number of available transactions (inclusive).
2. While all options besides `INDEX` are optional, **you must specify at least one field** you wish to edit (i.e. `Name`, `Type`, `Amount`, `Datetime`, `Location`, or `Category`).
3. If the `Name`, `Type`, or `Amount` options are present in the edit command, the values provided for these options cannot be empty. (See [Failed Execution (Example 3) below](#example-3-2))
4. **Specially for the Edit feature:** Empty values are allowed for `Datetime`, `Location`, and `Category`. If these options are provided in the edit command but left empty, the default values that these fields will take are stated in the table below. (See [Successful Execution (Example 3) below](#example-3-1))
5. The `INDEX` option must be specified first. The order in which you specify the other options does not matter.
6. Editing a transaction's category will result in the **replacement of all existing categories**. 
   - For example, in the case of a `Transaction` with two existing categories (Entertainment and Hobbies), editing it with `edit INDEX c/Education` will replace all existing categories, leaving the transaction with a single category, "Education".

**Default Values for Blank Options:**

| Option Name | Default Value                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| INDEX       | (NA)                                |
| n/          | (NA)                                |
| type/       | (NA)                                |
| amt/        | (NA)                                |
| dt/         | Current date time of system's clock |
| l/          | `-`                                 |
| c/          | (Blank)                             |

#### Find Transactions

Finds a `Transaction` in UniCa$h.

Command: `find [n/NAME] [l/LOCATION] [c/CATEGORY]`

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
For more information about the prefix constraints, refer to the
[command breakdown's prefix types section](#prefix-types)
</div>

Command Words Accepted: `find`, `search`, `f` (all case-insensitive)

Command Parameters:

| Parameter        | Optional?       | Purpose                                                      |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| n/               | Yes*            | Search keyword for the name of a transaction.                |
| l/               | Yes*            | Search keyword for the location of a transaction.            |
| c/               | Yes*            | Search keyword for a category tagged to a transaction        |
| Any of the above | Min. one option | At least one option must be specified for the `find` command |


Important notes:

1. While all options are optional, at least one option must be specified in total.
2. Only one instance of each option can be specified, i.e. `n/Friends n/Dinner` is invalid as the name
      option is specified more than once.
3. All keywords specified must match in order for a transaction to be displayed.
4. For each keyword, a substring match is required, thus `find n/with friends` will search for transactions
whose name contains the string "with friends". However, an exact full name match is not required
thus, a transaction with the name `Lunch with friends outside` is still considered a match.

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The find command, like get_total_expenditure, creates a filter on the `Transactions List`
and this filter persists across commands.

<br><br>Therefore, it is expected that any changes to the `Transactions List` after the `find` command
is used may result in transactions being hidden as they may no longer abide by the filter applied by `find`.

<br>Use the `list` command when this occurs to reset the filter and view all transactions
</div>

#### Clear Transactions

Clears all transactions in UniCa$h.

Command: `clear_transactions`

Command Words Accepted: `clear_transactions` only (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
This command irreversibly deletes all transactions in UniCa$h. Thus, as an added layer
of safety, the command has no short form alternatives and is intentionally lengthy. Additionally,
it cannot be followed with any arguments, options, or non-whitespace text.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
While this command will erase all transactions in UniCa$h, the current `Transactions List`
configuration is still subject to any filters applied by `find` or `get_total_expenditure`,
which you can read about under the `find` command section [here](#find-transaction)
or under the `get_total_expenditure` command section [here](#get-total-expenditure).
</div>

##### Successful Execution

**Example 1**

> **Case**: Command entered with correct format
>
> **Input**: `clear_transactions`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> All transactions have been cleared!
> ```
>
> <img src="images/unicash/command-outputs/clearTransactions/clear.png" width="1000" />


##### Failed Execution

**Example 1**

> **Case**: Command entered with any trailing text 
>
> **Input**: `clear_transactions   asdfg` [OR] `clear_transactions today`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> Clear transactions command cannot have trailing arguments. Use the command clear_transactions
> without any trailing arguments.
> ```
<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span">
In the above example, it is made explicit that the `clear_transactions` command is not
meant for batch deletion of specific groups of transaction nor for mass deletion of
transactions present in a particular `Transaction List` configuration, and that this
command will always delete all transactions in UniCa$h.
</div>

### Budget Management

The budget serves as an observable metric used to allow users to understand when their expenses over a given interval. They can use this information to better understand if they should be controlling their spending or adjusting their budget.

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span">
For this team project, we have opted to simplify the budgeting feature by limiting the user to a single budget at a time that can be configured for different intervals and amounts.
</div>

#### Set Budget

Sets the user's budget on UniCa$h to be a given amount and within a given interval.

Command: `set_budget amt/Amount interval/Interval`

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
For more information about the prefix constraints, refer to the [command breakdown's prefix types section](#prefix-types)
</div>

#### Clear Budget

Clears the user's budget set in UniCa$h. If no budget is set yet, the user is prompted to set one first instead.

Command: `clear_budget`

Command Words Accepted: `clear_budget`, `cb` (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
`clear_budget` will not parse any additional argument or parameters. Even if additional argument or parameters are given, any existing budget will be cleared regardless, without any additional effects.
</div>

##### Successful Execution

**Example 1**

> **Case**: Clear user set budget.
>
> **Input**: `clear_budget`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> Budget cleared.

**Example 2**

> **Case**: Clear without set budget.
>
> **Input**: `clear_budget`
>
> **Output**:
> ```
> No budget to clear.
>
> Consider using set_budget amt/Amount interval/Interval first!
> ```

#### Get Budget

Retrieves the set budget and the spending over the given interval. If no budget has been set, the user will be prompted to set one first instead.

The user's spending is calculated by: `budget - interval expenses`.

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The [prefix types section](#prefix-types) contains a brief about how intervals are handled.
<br><br>
Expenses that fall within the interval are included and the total expense is computed relative to the budget.
<br>
1. Daily: expenses that occur within the same **day of year** (i.e. the expenses that occur on day `x` are included if today is day `x`, expenses on day `x +/- 1` are not includued)
<br>
2. Weekly: expenses that occur within the same **week of year**. This is dependent on the current year, for more information refer to the [documentation here.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/WeekFields.html#weekOfYear())
<br>
3. Monthly: expenses that occur within the same **month** (i.e. the expenses that occur in September are included if today falls under September)
</div>

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The usage is calculated from the list of filtered transactions so to view the budget remainder across all available transactions, use the `list` command first.
</div>

Command: `get_budget`

Command Words Accepted: `get_budget`, `gb` (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
`get_budget` will not parse any additional argument or parameters. Even if additional argument or parameters are given, no additional effects will be triggered.

### Financial Statistics

#### Get Total Expenditure

Retrieves the total expenditure by month with optional filters for category and year. Also filters the transaction list by the given month, year, and category.

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The total expenditure is calculated from the list of filtered transactions so to view the total expenditure across expense transactions, use the `list` command first.
</div>

Command: `get_total_expenditure month/Month [c/Category] [year/Year]`

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
For more information about the prefix constraints, refer to the [command breakdown's prefix types section](#prefix-types)
</div>

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The default value for the `year/` prefix, if not provided, is the current year in which the command is executed.
</div>

Command Words Accepted: `get_total_expenditure`, `get_total_exp`, `gte` (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The `get_total_expenditure` command, like `find`, creates a filter on the transactions list and this filter persists across commands.
<br><br>
Therefore, it is expected that any changes to the transaction list after `get_total_expenditure` may result in transactions being hidden as they may no longer abide by the filter applied by `get_total_expenditure`.
<br><br>
Use the `list` command when this occurs to view all transactions and clear any filters.
<br><br>
For more information on how `get_total_expenditure` is computed, refer to the [developer guide's section for it.](DeveloperGuide.html#get-total-expenditure)
</div>

#### Summary Statistics

Displays a summary of the expenses saved in UniCa$h.

Command: `summary`

Command Words Accepted: `summary` (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Any additional arguments given to `summary` will be ignored.
</div>

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The summary of expenses is a pop-up window. If there are no expenses saved in UniCa$h, the pop-up window will not appear.
<br>
Please be aware that if you open the summary window and subsequently delete all expenses from UniCa$h without
closing the summary window, it is intended to stay open until you manually close it. In such a scenario, the summary
window will look like the following:
<img src="images/unicash/command-outputs/summary/summarySuccessOutput3.png" width="1000" />
</div>

Important notes:

1. When making changes to your transactions in UniCa$h, the plots in the summary window will automatically update to
   reflect your modifications.

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
The **pie chart** showcases the **top 10 expense categories** based on their respective amounts, while the
**line chart** exclusively showcases expenses **from the past one year**, according to the system's clock.
<br>
This indicates that it is possible for only one plot to have data, while the other does not. (E.g. If there are
only expenses recorded from over a year ago, then only the pie chart will display data, while the line chart will not.)
</div>

##### Successful Execution

#### Reset UniCash

Resets UniCa$h to its default state with the default transactions

Command: `reset_unicash`

Command Words Accepted: `reset_unicash` only (case-insensitive)

<div class="callout callout-info" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Similar to `Clear Transactions`, this command overwrites all existing transactions in UniCa$h.
Thus, as an added layer of safety, the command has no short form alternatives.
It also cannot be followed with any arguments, options, or non-whitespace text.
</div>


<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
While this command will restore the default UniCa$h transactions, the current `Transactions List`
configuration is still subject to any filters applied by `find` or `get_total_expenditure`,
which you can read about under the `find` command section [here](#find-transaction)
or under the `get_total_expenditure` command section [here](#get-total-expenditure).
</div>
