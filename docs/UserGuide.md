    If you do not have it installed yet or your Java version is below `11`, refer to the following guides based on your operating system:

    - [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-371F38CC-248F-49EC-BB9C-C37FC89E52A0)

    - [macOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-F575EB4A-70D3-4AB4-A20E-DBE95171AB5F)

# Features

The features are categorised into:
- [Patient Management Features](#patient-management-features)
- [Doctor Management Features](#doctor-management-features)
- [Appointment Management Features](#appointment-management-features)
- [General Features](#general-features)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you would need to provide.<br>
  e.g. in `add n\NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n\John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. for `INDEX [dic\DOCTOR_NRIC] [pic\PATIENT_NRIC]`, both `DOCTOR_NRIC` and `PATIENT_NRIC` are optional. Valid inputs include `3 dic\T1023470J pic\S1875409K`, `3 pic\S1875409K` or even `3`.

* Parameters can be entered in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list_p` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
