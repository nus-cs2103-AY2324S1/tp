<br>

### Locating Patients by Name, ID or Appointment: `find`

Searches the patient list for all patients matching the [Name](#name), [ID](#ID) or [Appointment](#appointment)
and returns their related information.

* The search is case-insensitive.
e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`, `08-Jan-2023 12 13` will match `08-jan-2023 12 13`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Name, ID Number and Appointment can be searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* For the name and ID, only patients matching at least one keyword will be returned.
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
* For Appointment, patients with any overlap in their appointment timings will be returned.
  e.g. `10-Aug-2023 0900 0900` will return all patients with appointment timings containing that period.
* If multiple different fields are specified, they must ALL match the values given.
  e.g. `n/Hans Bo ap/10-Aug-2023 0900 0900` will return all patients matching BOTH the keywords `Hans Bo` and
  the appointment timing for 10th August 23, 9 o'clock.

[Format](#command-format):
 * `find n/NAME`
 * `find id/ID_NUMBER`
 * `find ap/APPT`
 * You may combine the fields. Example: `find n/NAME id/ID_NUMBER`

> :bulb: Use the shortcut `f` for faster patient-finding

![result for 'find id/S0123452F'](images/v1.4-screenshots/find.jpg)

> :bulb: This list command can be used to show the original patient list after a find command is executed

<br>

### Preserving a `find` Command Result in the Log: `log`

Logs the result of the [find command](#locating-patients-by-name-id-or-appointment--find)
to the [logger tab](#logger-tab), which can be viewed at all times.

Upon starting HealthSync, the logger tab is pre-populated with profiles of patients who have different appointments.

This is how it looks like:

![pre-populated log](images/v1.4-screenshots/logExample.jpg)

> :wrench: If you want to access the patient list or look up a new patient but would still need to refer to the current
> patient's details, simply `log` so the profile stays on your screen while you carry out your other tasks!

* Saving to the logger tab only works for results of the `find` command.
* The entire result will be saved.
* The result will be saved in the same order and format.
* Saving a new result completely clears the current saved result from the logger tab and replaces it.

[Format](#command-format):
`log`

> :bulb: Use the shortcut `lo` for faster patient-logging

Example Command: `log` (after performing a `find` on the list)

![result for 'log'](images/v1.4-screenshots/log.jpg)

Expected outputs when the command succeeds:
* `The last filtered values have overridden the logger tab.`

Expected output when the command fails:
* `Cannot log an empty list.`

> :bulb: `log` overwrites the data currently in the logger tab, so you do not need to clear the logger tab before using
> this command

> :warning: The logger tab does not update when logged patients' profiles are edited or deleted.
> The logger tab is intended to be a snapshot of the patients' details at the time that they were logged.
> To reflect the edited changes in the logger tab after a change has been made, do `log` after the change.

<br>

### Adding a New `find` Command Result to the current Log: `alog`

Appends the new results of the most recent [find command](#locating-patients-by-name-id-or-appointment--find)
to the current data in the [logger tab](#logger-tab), which can be viewed at all times.

> :bulb: Use `alog` to save patient data you want to continue referring to, on top of the profiles you currently have logged

> :wrench: If you have multiple patients you need to toggle between, and do not want to keep doing `find` to retrieve their data, simply `alog` so their profiles stay on your screen for easy access!


* Adding to the logger tab only works for results of the `find` command.
* The previously-saved result will remain the same.
* The entire new result will be saved below the previously-saved result.
* The result will be saved in the same order and format.
* Duplicate patients will not be appended to the log. 

[Format](#command-format):
`alog`

>:bulb: Use the shortcut `al` for faster log-appending

Example Command: `alog` (after entering a FindCommand)

![result for 'alog'](images/v1.4-screenshots/alog.jpg)

Expected outputs when the command succeeds:
* `The last filtered values have been added onto the logger tab.`

Expected output when the command fails:
* `Cannot log an empty list.`

> :bulb: `alog` does not overwrite the data and instead adds on to it, so you do not have to keep performing `log` to save more data

<br>

### Clearing Data from the Log: `clog`

Clears all current data in the [logger tab](#logger-tab).

> :bulb: Use `clog` command if you do not need the data in the current logger tab anymore

[Format](#command-format):
`clog`

> :bulb:  Use the shortcut `cl` for faster log-clearing

Example Command: `clog`

![result for 'clog'](images/v1.4-screenshots/clog.jpg)

Expected output:
* `Logger tab has been cleared!`

<br>

### Undoing a Command: `undo`

Undoes the last undo-able action within HealthSync.

* An undo-able action includes the `add`, `clear`, `delete`, `edit`, `log`, `alog` and `clog` commands.
* `undo` allows you to undo a specific number of previous commands if you specify a number behind the keyword.
* `undo` can only undo the previous commands provided
  it does not exceed the size of the [command history stack](#command-history-stack).

> :warning: Upon closing HealthSync, the undo history will be erased

[Format](#command-format):
* `undo [number]`

> :bulb: Note that this command uses `[number]`! This means you can optionally put in the
 number of actions you wish to undo.

> :bulb: Use `u` as a shortcut for `undo`

> :bulb: Simply entering `undo` will undo the last command

Example commands:
*  `undo 2`

![result for 'undo'](images/v1.4-screenshots/undo.jpg)

Expected outputs when the command succeeds:

* `Undoing 2 command(s): ...`

Expected outputs when command fails:
* `Please proved a valid number of steps to undo, not exceeding the available command history.`
* `Undo step count cannot be a negative number or zero.`

<br>

### Exiting HealthSync: `exit`

Exits HealthSync.

[Format](#command-format):
`exit`

> :bulb: Use `ex` as a shortcut for `exit`

<br>

### Auto Save

HealthSync data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data is executed.
There is no need to save manually.

> :bulb: Only patient details inside [patient list view](#patient-list-view) are saved.
> The [logger tab](#logger-tab) and [command history](#command-history-stack) used for `undo` are not saved
> after the application is closed.

<br>

### Editing the Data File

HealthSync data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/healthsync.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> :warning: **Caution:**
>If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HealthSync will discard all data and start with an empty
>data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.
>
>To make a backup of the file:
>1) Locate the `healthsync.json` data file on your computer. This file is located in the same directory as `healthsync.jar`. The path is `[JAR file location]/data/healthsync.json`.
>2) Right-click on the `healthsync.json` file, and select 'copy'.
>3) Choose the location where you want to store the backup copy. You can create a separate folder for backups or choose any locations of your choice.
>4) Right-click in the chosen location and select 'paste'. This creates a copy of the `healthsync.json` data file in the selected backup location.
>
>That's it! You can now safely edit the original `healthsync.json` file.
>
>If anything goes wrong during the editing process, you can restore your data by copying the backup file back to its original location.

<br>

## Glossary

### Command Format

Refers to the standardized way you have to type in your instructions to HealthSync.
Currently, there are 2 main types of Command Formats.

 * [Fielded](#fields) commands, which require you to add additional information behind the instruction.
 * Field-less commands, which do not need you to specify any more information to function.

Fielded Command Formats will generally look like this:
```
<KEYWORD> <identity> <field>... <[field]>
```

 * `<KEYWORD>` is the word used to tell HealthSync what to do.
   * Example: to tell HealthSync to add a patient, you would use `add` as the keyword.
 
 * `<identity>` represents compulsory identifying fields that need to be included with for that instruction type.
   * See [Fields](#fields) to understand how identifying fields are specified.

 * `<field>` refer to the information fields that can be specified in each command.
   * Unless otherwise specified, the specified field is compulsory. 
   * Example: for `add`, you would specify additional information like phone number and address.
   * See [Fields](#fields) to understand how each entry is specified.

 * Square brackets `[<field>]` indicate that the field is optional to include for that command.
   * Example: if the command specifies `[ap/APPT]`, you can choose if you wish to specify an appointment or not
              for that particular command.

 * `<field>...` indicate that multiple information fields can be provided.
   * If `<field>` is specified, multiple values for that particular field type can be provided.
     * Example: if the command specifies `m/MEDICAL_HISTORY...`, you can specify `m/First History m/Second History`.
   * If `<field>` is directly given in square brackets, then you may optionally add multiple different field types
     behind that command.
     * Example: if the command directly specifies `<[field]>...`, you can specify any of `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `ap/APPT`,
       etc.
     * The information fields are restricted by how they are specified. See [Fields](#fields) to see the
       restrictions placed on the fields.

 * `or` can be specified between 2 identifying fields. This means that you may exclude one of the fields
   for that instruction type, or you may mix-and-match to include them together.
   * EXAMPLE: for `edit n/NAME` *or* `edit id/ID_NUMBER` can be given as `edit n/John`, `edit id/001A`
     or `edit n/John id/001A`.

 * `<identity>`, `<field>` and `<[field]>` can generally be specified in any order.
   * Example: if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

Field-less Command Formats will generally look like this:
```
<KEYWORD>
```

 * For field-less commands, only the `<KEYWORD>` will be read by HealthSync, and the rest of the data you give it
   will be ignored.
   * Example: if `help 123` was typed in, HealthSync will interpret it as `help`.

Exceptions to the format exist, but rest assured as you will be told that they do not follow the standard
when they are encountered.

### Fields

Fields are the entries you have to input the patient's information for. These would
include names, phone numbers, appointment times, etc. Fields can be classified into
2 groups:
* Identifying fields, to let you know who the patient is. These are unique to the patient entry.
* Information fields, which gives you other information on the patient.

The 2 identifying fields of a patient are given below:

| Tag   | Representative Value         | Example Usage     | General Form in Commands |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| `n/`  | [Name](#name)                | `n/Alex`          | `n/NAME`                 |
| `id/` | [Identification Number](#ID) | `id/S2345678A`    | `id/ID_NUMBER`           |

1 or more identifying fields must be specified in each command, unless stated otherwise.

In addition to the identifying fields, information fields can be specified behind commands.
The information fields are given below:

| Tag    | Representative Value                | Example Usage              | General Form in Commands | Remarks                         |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `p/`   | [Phone Number](#phone-number)       | `p/91234567`               | `p/PHONE_NUMBER`         |                                 |
| `e/`   | [Email Address](#email-address)     | `e/example@a.com`          | `e/EMAIL`                |                                 |
| `a/`   | [Address](#address)                 | `a/Location, Here Rd`      | `a/ADDRESS`              |                                 |
| `m/`   | [Medical History](#medical-history) | `m/Asthmatic`              | `m/MEDICAL_HISTORY`      | Can have multiple of this field |
| `ap/`  | [Appointment](#appointment)         | `ap/11-2-2023 11:00 12:00` | `ap/APPT`                |                                 |

#### Name

The standard unique identifier for your patient. Each patient should have a unique alphanumeric name assigned to them.

#### ID

The ID-based unique identifier for your patient. Each patient should have a unique alphanumeric ID assigned to them.

There is no verification system in place for ID. This allows you to use your custom identifier for your patients, if
you wish.

#### Phone Number

A phone number to contact your patients with. Each patient should be assigned to 1 phone number.

Phone numbers must be numeric, and it must be at least 3 digits long. It does not have to be unique.

#### Email Address

An email address to contact your patients with. Each patient should be assigned to 1 email address, which
doesn't need to be unique.

Emails should be in the format `local-part@domainname`.
 * `local-part` is alphanumeric, and may also contain these symbols: `+` `_` `.` `-`
 * `domainname` should be the site that the email leads to, such as `gmail.com`, `mail`.
 * These must be separated by an `@` symbol.

#### Address

The address to contact your patients. Each patient should be assigned to 1 address that they live in,
and it does not have to be unique.

Addresses do not have a strict format to adhere to.

#### Medical History

The medical history of your patients. These are optional fields to assign to patients, and every
patient can have more than 1 medical history.

Individually, medical histories do not have a strict format to adhere to. However, every medical
history a patient has should be unique from one another.

Some examples of valid Medical History formats are listed here:
```
Hypertension
Covid-19
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
```

#### Appointment

The appointment slot assigned to your patients. A patient may have no appointment assigned to them.
Currently, only 1 appointment may be assigned to a patient at a time.

Appointments should be given in this sequence: `Date, Start Time, End Time`. For example,
`1-Aug-2023, 11:00 13:00` is a valid appointment denoting an appointment on 1st August 2023, from 11am
to 1pm.
 * The month and day of the appointment should always be included.
 * Day can be given as a 1 to 2-digit number. It will only be accepted if the day can exist in that month or year.
 * Month can be given as a 1 to 2-digit number or a 3-letter word. Example: `Jun` and `6` both represent June.
 * The year is optional. If not included, HealthSync assumes it to be this year.
 * The date should be hyphenated.
 * The time should be given in 24-hour clock format, with 00:00 as 12am.
 * Colons are optional when time is given with hours and minutes. If no colons are given, you need to pad the hour with
   a zero when necessary. Example: `1200` for 12 noon, `0900` for 9am.
 * You may exclude minutes if you wish. Example: `15` will be interpreted as 3pm.
 * Date and the 2 Times needs to be separated by a comma or a space.
 * Appointment with the start and end time being the same is valid (ie. 0-minute appointment). HealthSync will register the start time as it is, and register end time as unconfirmed. This is useful for when you are unsure of the end time of an appointment.

Some examples of valid Appointment formats are listed here:
```
1-Nov 8 10
1-11-2023 10 12
03-03-23 0800 1400
4-Sep, 1800, 2000
```

### CLI
Command Line Interface. Refers to computer programs which require you to type to interact with it.

### GUI
Graphical User Interface. Refers to computer programs with a visual window you can interact with directly.

### Menu Sidebar
The Menu Sidebar is the area on the left of the Patient List View. It contains buttons that allow you to perform actions on HealthSync. Currently, only the `User Guide` and `Exit` buttons are functional. The buttons that are in grey and not pressable in the Menu Sidebar are currently not functional and will be implemented in a future version of HealthSync.

### [Patient List View](#patient-list-view)
The main part of HealthSync where the list of all your patients are displayed. This is where you can view a list of [Patient Card](#patient-card)(s), and perform actions on them. When actions are performed, the Patient List View will be updated to reflect the changes/results.

### [Patient Card](#patient-card)
A card that represents a patient in the Patient List View. 

![patient card](images/v1.4-screenshots/personCard.jpg)
<br>
Annotation of Person Card (From top-to-bottom):
1. Patient's name, ID
2. Medical Histories (in the form of bubble tags)
2. Phone Number
3. Address
4. Email Address 
5. Medical Appointment.

### Logger Tab
A 'sticky-note'-like area on the right of the Patient List View. Serves as a snapshot of the patient data at the time they were logged with the [`log` command](#preserving-a-find-command-result-in-the-log--log).

This comes in handy when you want to refer to certain patient profiles at the side, while still being able to carry on with other tasks.

To maximise utility, upon app start, the logger tab displays a list of profiles of patients who have appointments on the day itself. This can be overwritten by the `log` command for patient profiles thereafter.

### Output Box
A small box right below the Patient List View where HealthSync will provide any feedback it has on the instructions
it has performed. This includes error messages, success messages, and other information like example commands.

### Command Box
The area where you type your instructions for HealthSync to perform.<br>
> :bulb: You can use the `Spacebar` to focus on the Command Box. This allows you to type your instructions without using the mouse to click on the Command Box.

### Command History Stack
The group of instructions HealthSync remembers performing. This group allows HealthSync to undo the
instructions and return your list to an older state. This stack will be cleared when you exit HealthSync.

### Java
A piece of software that our program builds on. In order to use HealthSync, your computer must be running at least
version 11 of Java. [Get it here.](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)

### JSON
JavaScript Object Notation. This is the file format used by HealthSync to save and store information.
