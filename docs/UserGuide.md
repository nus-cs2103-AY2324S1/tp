## **Quick Start**

### **Download and Installation**

1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `LoveBook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp).
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The window that appears will be similar to the one below. <br>
    <br>
   ![startScreen](images/emptyLoveBook.png) 
    <br>
4. Follow the tutorial below to get started.

### **Navigating the GUI**

If you're new to this program, the initial screen might appear a bit daunting. Don't fret; let's explore the various
elements of the LoveBook interface together.
We suggest enlarging the program window for a clearer perspective, allowing you to view more content.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the LoveBook screen: <br>
![GUI](images/navigation.png)

- **Menu Bar** - This is where you can find the `File` and `Help` options. Click on `File` to access the `Exit` option.
  Click on `Help` to access the `Help` option.
- **Command Box** - This is where you type in your commands. Press `Enter` to execute the command.
- **Presets Bar** - This is where you can find the preset commands. Click on a preset command to populate your command
  box.
- **Result Display** - This is where the results of your commands are displayed.
- **Date List Panel** - This is where the list of dates are displayed. The list is scrollable, and you can scroll up and
  down to view the entire list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **LoveBook Tutorial: Getting started**

Now that you are familiar with the layout of LoveBook, we recommend you try the following steps to develop a feel for
the core features of LoveBook.

#### 1. Adding a date

So you've just started dating. How do you begin using this app?

Let's say you went out on a date with John. Throughout your date you find out key things about him, he's 123cm tall,
earns 3k a month, his horoscope is Libra.
Here you can add John to LoveBook using the add command:

In the command box, enter `add name/John Doe age/21 gender/M height/123 income/3000 horoscope/Libra` and press
the `enter` key.
This will add John to LoveBook. <br>

<img src="images/user-commands/addCommandExample.png" height="250" width="600"/> <br>

Let's imagine you've added a couple of dates to the LoveBook already. It should look something like this now: <br>

<img src="images/user-commands/addCommandExample2.png" height="250" width="600"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 2. Starring a date

With so many dates you might want to start keeping tabs on dates that are perhaps more exceptional. Fret not, star dates
as you go along
in your journey. Here you can star John for instance, using the star command:
Enter `star 2`.
This will star John. <br>

![starCommandExample](images/user-commands/starCommandExample.png) <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 3. Filtering dates

With so many dates, you might want to start filtering down to the metrics that matter. Perhaps you seek someone younger,
simply filter for
a specific age. Here you can filter for an age of 21 for instance, using the filter command:
Enter `filter age/21`.
This will filter for John. <br>

![filterCommandExample](images/user-commands/filterCommandExample.png) <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4. Set Preferences

Well, maybe you are indecisive as a serial dater, and you want a third party opinion. Fret not, simply begin by keying
in your preferences using the
setPreferences command:
Enter `setP age/22 height/130 income/3200 horoscope/Libra`
This will set your preferences like so: <br>

![setPreferencesCommandExample](images/user-commands/setPreferencesCommandExample.png) <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 5. Best Match

And here it is, to get the match of your dreams, simply use the bestMatch command:
Enter `bestMatch` <br>

![bestMatchCommandExample](images/user-commands/bestMatchCommandExample.png) <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Congrats! You have completed the tutorial!

The tutorial shows you what a typical workflow might look like on LoveBook. Do continue to peruse the commands section
which contains
other commands that, while not worth covering in a quick start tutorial, are certainly important to using LoveBook as a
whole.
Here's to you embarking on your LoveBook journey!

## **Features**

<box type="tip">

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `edit INDEX METRIC/NEW_ARG`, `INDEX`, `NEW_ARG` and `METRIC` are parameters which can be used as
  `edit 2 income/3000`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `age/AGE [horoscope/HOROSCOPE]` can be used as `age/22 horoscope/ARIES` or as `age/22`.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME age/AGE`, `age/AGE name/NAME` is also acceptable.
* For commands that accept a positive integer, the integer cannot be preceded with a leading zero.
  For instance, `star 9` is valid, but `star 09` is invalid
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`)
  will be ignored.<br> e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### **Sorting, Finding dates**

#### **Finding a date: `find`**

Format: `find NAME [MORE_NAMES]`

<box type="tip">

More names can be added to the command line, and the search will be conducted for all names provided.

</box>

Example:

- `find Cleon`
- `find Cleon John`

Expected Output: `Lists the dates with the name(s) specified`

[Scroll back to *Table of Contents*](#table-of-contents)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Filtering dates by a certain metric: `filter`**

Filters the dates in the LoveBook by a specific metric.

Format: `filter METRIC/ARG`

<box type="tip">

* Metric is limited to `gender, age, name, height` only
* Arguments should be non-empty and adhere to the constraints of the metric
* Multiple valid METRIC/ARG pairs can be added to the command line, and the search will be conducted for all pairs
  provided. e.g. `filter gender/M age/21`
* Filter format is valid as long as there is one valid METRIC/ARG pair. e.g. `filter xx gender/M` works as well, where xx is not a metric

</box>

<box type="important">

When filtering dates by a valid metric and an invalid metric, the valid METRIC/ARG pair will be used to filter the dates. 
Note that the invalid metric will be ignored and there will be no checking of the validity of the invalid metric value.

</box>

Example:

- `filter name/Cleon`
- `filter gender/M`
- `filter gender/M name/Cleon`
- `filter hi gender/M` (provides flexibility to the user in the case they mistype a metric)
- `filter income/20 name/Cleon` (this only returns dates with name Cleon since income is an invalid metric)

Expected Output: `Lists the dates with the valid metric values specified`

[Scroll back to *Table of Contents*](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Sorting dates by a certain metric: `sort`**

Sorts the dates in the LoveBook by a specific metric.

Format: `sort METRIC/ORDER`

<box type="tip">

* Metrics are limited to `name/`, `age/`, `height/`, `income/` and `horoscope/` only.
* Order is limited to `increasing` or `decreasing` only and is case-sensitive.
* Sort command is valid as long as there is only one valid METRIC/ORDER pair and no other metrics are provided.

</box>

<box type="important">

When sorting dates by a field where both have an equal value, say Kevin and Wayne are sorted by income and both have
an income of 2000, applying commands such as edit or star, can affect the stability of the sort. However, the overall
sorting order by value is preserved.
             
</box>

Example:

- `sort name/increasing`
- `sort horoscope/decreasing`
- `sort xx income/decreasing`, where xx is not a metric (provides flexibility to the user in the case they mistype a metric)

Expected Output: `Lists the dates in the order specified`

[Scroll back to *Table of Contents*](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* By default, Date Preference is set to:
    * AGE: 21
    * HEIGHT: 170

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file with the file that
contains the data of your previous LoveBook home folder.

**Q**: Is my data stored in the cloud? Will I be open to data breaches?<br>
**A**: No, all your data is stored locally, no need to fear a potential data hack.

**Q**: Do I have to save before exiting the application for my data to safely backed up on my computer? <br>
**A**: All your data is saved on your computer as soon as you enter the command in. There is no need to manually save
your data. In the event of a power outage, all your data will be safe.

**Q**: Where do I go if I have issues with LoveBook? <br>
**A**: You may leave your issues [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/issues).

to manually edit the data file.
