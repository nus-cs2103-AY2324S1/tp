# iVolunteer User Guide

iVolunteer is your dedicated application for volunteer coordination, designed with **volunteer coordinators** in mind. If you're looking to enhance your volunteer coordination tasks, iVolunteer is the tool that empowers you to **manage volunteers and volunteering events efficiently**. iVolunteer streamlines the process for **swift and effective coordination**, by combining the efficiency of a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the advantages of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

**Command Line Interface (CLI):** a text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators such as primary notation.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `vfind n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `vfind n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/friendly` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILL]…​` can be used as `s/friendly`, `s/friendly s/caring` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `vlist`, `elist`, and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

  * Duplicated materials are materials with the same material name and quantity. As a result, `m/23 potatoes` and `m/50 potatoes` are not duplicates.
  * Duplicated roles are materials with the same role name and quantity. For example, `r/23 farmers` and `r/50 farmers` are not duplicates.
  * Take note that duplicated materials and roles are case-sensitive: `m/23 Potatoes` and `m/23 potatoes` are not duplicates.
  * To remove duplicates, you can use the [`eedit` command](#edit-the-details-of-an-event-eedit) and re-build the entire role or material list. Examples: `eedit EVENT_INDEX r/23 farmers r/50 cleaners` or `eedit EVENT_INDEX m/23 potatoes m/3 fields`.
* The budget argument must be a number in 2 decimal places.
* The maximum number of volunteers argument must be a non-negative integer.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:** 
- If the end date and time is not specified, iVolunteer will automatically set the end date and time to **exactly 3 hours** after the start date and time.
- If the maximum number of volunteers argument is not specified, iVolunteer will not set a limit to the number of volunteers within the event.
  - Alternatively, if the maximum number of volunteers is set to 0 (e.g. `ecreate ... vs/0`), iVolunteer will remove a limit to the number of volunteer within the event.
- Roles needed can be fulfilled by adding the volunteer of that specific skill into the event. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) for more information.
- Materials needed can be fulfilled using the `eaddm` command. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) for more information.

## FAQ

**Q**: As a Windows 11 user, how do I open a command terminal?<br>
**A**: On your Windows 11 computer, do the following:
1. Select the Start Menu (the Windows icon) in the taskbar, or press the Windows key.
2. Type `cmd` in the search bar.
3. Select Command Prompt from the list.

**Q**: As a Mac user, how do I open a command terminal?<br>
**A**: On your Mac, do one of the following:
1. Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.
2. In the Finder, open the `/Applications/Utilities` folder, then double-click Terminal.

**Q**: How do I fill up the *role* information within the UI?<br><br>
![Adding role in UI](images/user-guide/add-to-roles.png)<br><br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**A**: To add a **volunteer** with a certain role, you can use the [`eaddv` command](#adding-a-volunteer-into-an-event-eaddv) as follows:
1. Ensure that the volunteer's skill matches the role of the event you want to fill up (both role and skills are case-sensitive).
   * In the example image above, volunteers with skills `chef` or `cooking` can be added. If not, you can use the [`eedit` command](#edit-the-details-of-an-event-eedit) (e.g. `eedit VOLUNTEER_INDEX s/cooking s/other_skill`) to change the volunteer's skills to match the role.
2. Use the `eaddv eid/EVENT_INDEX vid/VOLUNTEER_INDEX` command to add the volunteer to the event. For example, if the volunteer with skill `cooking` you want to add is in index `3` of the displayed volunteer list, and the event with role `cooking` required is in index `4` of the displayed event list, then you can use `eaddv vid/3 eid/4` to add that volunteer into the event.
3. You should notice that the `cooking` role would be **incremented by 1** in the UI. In the example above, since `1 / 2 cooking` skills has been filled up, the addition of the new volunteer will cause the role `cooking` to be updated to `2 / 2 cooking`. The role will also turn green since there are already 2 volunteers with role `cooking`.

**Q**: How do I fill up the *material* information within the UI?<br><br>
![Adding material in UI](images/user-guide/add-to-materials.png)<br><br>
**A**: To add **materials** to the event, you can use the [`eaddm` command](#adding-and-tracking-quantity-of-materials-into-an-event-eaddm) as follows:
1. Find the event to add materials in within the displayed volunteer list. You can use the `elist` command to list all events.
2. Take note of the event index and add the appropriate amount of materials to the event. For example, if the event is in index `4` within the displayed event list and since there are `0 / 50 cookwares` in this event, you can run the command `eaddm eid/4 m/50 cookwares` to update the current amount of materials within the event.
3. You should notice that the `cookwares` material would be **incremented by the amount specified** in the `eaddm` command within the UI. In the example above, the `eaddm` command would update the material to `50 / 50 cookwares`. The material would also turn green in the UI to indicate that you have fulfilled the material requirement for the event.
