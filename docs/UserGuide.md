## Introduction
Flashlingo is a versatile desktop application centered around learning words through flashcards. It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI),
while also providing the advantages of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI). Tailored with a focus on **beginner language
learners** with [to be discussed] proficiency in command line, Flashlingo specializes in expanding vocabulary. If you are not familiar with the command line interface (CLI), you can refer to the [**Glossary**](#glossary) section below,
and the [**Command Summary**](#command-summary) section for a quick overview of the commands.


The application leverages the scientifically-proven principle of the [**Forgetting Curve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
By incorporating the forgetting curve concept, Flashlingo schedules review sessions, ensuring words are revisited at
optimal intervals to enhance long-term memory retention. This method assists users in effectively retaining and expanding their vocabulary over time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Application Features
Flashlingo predominantly consists of two main features: **Managing flash cards** and **Reviewing flash cards**
- **Managing flash cards**
  - Users are given the ability to add, delete and edit flash cards. And each flashcard is assigned with a `level`, which
  indicates the proficiency of the user with the word. The level of the flashcard will be updated after each review session.
* **Reviewing flash cards**
   - In each review session, words that require reviewing will be presented to users one by one. For each word, users can indicate whether
     - they have memorized the word
     <br>
     This will advance the word into the next `level`, meaning less frequent review for the word in the near future.
     - they have forgotten the word
     <br>
        This will decrease the `level` by 1, meaning more frequent review for the word in the near future.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the level:**<br>

* The higher the `Level` is, the higher the proficiency of the user with the word is. The maximum level is 5, and it will be displayed as `word mastered`.

* Words which are indicated as `word mastered` will not appear in review session.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `flashlingo.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases) (Not finished yet).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Flashlingo.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar flashlingo.jar` command to run the application.
   Below shows the steps to perform such a task
    1. Open up the terminal.
    * For mac users, press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight search, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`.

    * For windows users, press `Windows + R` keys simultaneously, type `cmd` and press `Enter`.
    2. Navigate to the folder containing the jar file. In this example, it is in the Downloads folder. So the command is:
       <br>
       ```cd Downloads```
       <br>
       >Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) for more information on how to navigate to a folder in the terminal.
    3. Simply type in `java -jar flashlingo.jar` to get started!

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Flashlingo home folder.

**Q**: How can I import my data to the app?<br>
**A**: Save your words and translations in the format specified above in an Excel file. Move the file to the same folder with `flashlingo.jar`.
Then, use the `load` command to import the data.

**Q**: What may be the reasons why my data cannot be loaded into the app?<br>
**A**: 
* First, check your file name by opening the located folder. The file name should be directly displayed. Also, you can right-click the file to view the file name in its detailed info.
* If Flashlingo still cannot read the file, try inputting file name with and without the extension `.xlsx` in the `load` command. This may solve potential issues with file name loading within different systems.
* Secondly, ensure the content in your file is correctly formatted and valid. All rules can be found [here](#load).

**Q**: After I reviewed a flash card, I edited details of the card by the `edit` command. Will I see these changes immediately reflected in the review session?<br>
**A**:
* Unfortunately, no. The card is updated synchronously in the card list and the review session of Flashlingo. However, since the user has already reviewed the same card on the day, the card will not be included in the review session again.
* To see the edits made, User can use the `list` or `find` command to locate the specific card in the card list. The changes will also be reflected in the next review session for that flash card.

**Q**: If the displayed level of a flash card is "Word Mastered", what can I do if I want to review the card again?<br>
**A**:
* Currently, there's no way for user to manually change the level of a flash card. Flashlingo is designed to automatically remove words that learners are familiar with from the review session.
* However, if user must review the card, he/she can first use the `delete` command to delete the card and then use the `add` command to re-add the same card. The new card will be reset to level 1 and added in the review session.

| **CLI**                               | A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system. You can check the tutorial [**here**](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html)                                                                             |
| **GUI**                               | A graphical user interface (GUI) is a digital interface in which a user interacts with graphical components such as icons, buttons, and menus.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **JSON** | JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format commonly used for representing structured data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Level**                             | The level represents the proficiency with a specific flashcard. The higher the `Level` is, the higher the proficiency of the user with the word is.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Review Session**                    | A review session is a designated phase within the system where words requiring review are presented individually. Users can confirm their understanding or signal a need for further review.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Forgetting Curve**                  | The forgetting curve illustrates the decline in memory retention over time if information is not periodically reviewed or reinforced. It demonstrates a rapid loss of information shortly after learning, with the most significant decline in the initial hours or days. The rate of forgetting gradually decreases over time. |
