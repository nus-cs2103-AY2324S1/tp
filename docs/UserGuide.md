## Product Description

CheckMate is a **desktop app for streamlining the process of room bookings by hotel employees, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, you can maximise real-time room searching, service scheduling, and amenity management. Optimized for administrative roles, it ensures that room allocation and guest needs are seamlessly addressed.

<summary style="padding-left: 20px;"><strong>Command Format</strong></summary>
<div markdown="1">

### Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [rk/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe rk/Extra Pillows` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `r/ROOM d/BOOKING_PERIOD`, `d/BOOKING_PERIOD r/ROOM` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

### Prefix Completion

Pressing `tab` while inputting a command will autocomplete relevant command prefix with examples. If no prefixes are found, your input will blink red.

Example:

* `add` followed by `space` and `tab` results in `add r/1`.
* `edit INDEX` followed by `space` and `tab` 
  * gives the unused prefix with the actual information for the booking at the index.

Prefix completions only works with `add` and `edit` command and does not validate your input format.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
