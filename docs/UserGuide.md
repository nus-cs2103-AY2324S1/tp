# MediSync User Guide

MediSync is a **desktop app specifically used for head nurses to manage staff and patients, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Instead of tracking data of staff and patients using existing applications such as Microsoft Excel, using a CLI-centric application like MediSync will help head nurses track and handle contact management more quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `medisync.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MediSync.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar medisync.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/patient a/Alex Yeoh` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to MediSync.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Glossary

MediSync strives to streamline the storage and identification of contacts, focusing on essential information that are critical in medical contexts.

Here are some definitions that are noteworthy when using MediSync.

| Term                | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role                | The **role** of a person in the contact list is either `Doctor`, `Nurse`, or `Patient`. When we use the word staff, we are implying both `Doctor`s and `Nurse`s.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Affiliation         | With staff members providing care to specific `Patient`s, there is a need to establish an association between staff members and `Patient`s. We use **affiliations** to denote such relationships. Such relationships can never be one-sided in MediSync, and it will not exist between staff members or between `Patient`s.                                                  |
| Affiliation History | Having some level of history-taking is vital in tracking medical care. The use of **affiliation history** is to track past staff members that had affiliations with a particular `Patient`, and vice-versa. MediSync allows for the deletion of these history, but existing affiliations can never be deleted from the affiliation history until the affiliation is severed. |
| Shift Days          | **Shift days** is an attribute unique to staff members. For simplicity, the current version of MediSync monitors the workdays of each staff member in blocks of days.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Next of Kin         | The **Next of Kin** attribute is meant for `Patient`s. Having a method of contact with the `Patient`s next of kin is vital in medical care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Specialisations      | Exclusively for `Doctor`s, the **specialisations** attribute offers added information about each doctor, enabling the appropriate doctor to be matched with patients having diverse requirements.                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [a/AFFN_NAME]` can be used as `n/John Doe a/Sam Young` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[a/AFFN_NAME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `a/Sam Young`, `a/Sam Young a/Ben Chua` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Command are first checked for their formatting before checking the validity of the inputs.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Information cleared are irretrievable. As MediSync do not have confirmation prompts, do not, in any way, input this command if there are no intentions of using it.

</box>


### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`


### Saving the data

MediSync data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


### Editing the data file

MediSync data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/medisync.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MediSync will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

Be very careful, especially when you modify attributes such as Role, as any mismatch in Affiliations will render the data as invalid e.g. Changing the Role of a Patient to Doctor resulting in this new Doctor having affiliations with another Doctor. Scenarios like these are not exhaustive.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MediSync home folder.

### More FAQ to come

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
