## Features

* For a quick glance at all the commands and features, please refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `edit INDEX /n NAME`, `INDEX` and `NAME` are parameters that can be used as `edit 3 /n John Doe`.

* Commands, prefixes and most parameters are to be entered in lowercase. You can only enter capitalized letters for parameters of `NAME`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS`.<br>

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `/n NAME [/p PHONE]` can be used as `/n John Doe /p 98988989` or as `/n John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `/n NAME /p PHONE`, `/p PHONE /n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

`edit INDEX [/n NAME] [/e EMAIL] [/p PHONE] [/a ADDRESS] [/b BANK_ACCOUNT] [/jd JOIN_DATE] [/s SALARY] [/l ANNUAL_LEAVE] `

* Edits the employee at the specified `INDEX`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div>

* **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
Please input the field parameters in the correct format. You can refer to the <a href="#parameter-formats">parameter formats</a> for more information.
</div>

**Examples:**
*  `edit 1 /p 91234567 /e johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st employee to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* If the command is incorrect, the app should display the following message.
  <br>![result for incorrect edit command](images/incorrectEditCommand.png)
* If you did not specify any field to edit, the app should display the following message.
  <br>![result for no field to edit](images/noFieldToEdit.png)
* If you try to edit the field without any change, i.e., the existing field is exactly the same as the one you want to change into, the app should display the following message.
  <br>![result for no change in edit command](images/noChangeInEdit1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting an employee: `delete`

**What it does**

This feature allows users to delete an employee based on index or name.

**Command Format**

`delete INDEX` or `delete /n NAME`


* Deletes the employee at the specified `INDEX` or with the name `NAME`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div>

* The `NAME` must be in the correct [format](#parameter-formats).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
To allow greater flexibility in terms of searching, if there are 2 or more employees with same name, i.e. Amy Tan and Amy Teo, entering the command <code>delete /n FULLNAME</code> of any of the employee will still return a list of these employees instead of deleting the employee that matches the full name. 
</div>

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd employee in the employee directory.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st employee in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete /n Betsy` will delete the employee with the name 'Betsy' if there is only one such employee with this name. If there is no such employee, there will be an error message displayed. Otherwise, it will return you a list of employees with the name 'Betsy' and you will have to follow up with a `delete INDEX` command to delete the 'Betsy' that you want using the index displayed in the list.

**Output:**
* If the index is valid or there is only one employee in the list, whose name contains the keyword, ManaGease should display a confirmation message indicating that the employee information has been successfully deleted.
* The employee's list should be updated by removing the employee.
  <br>![result for deleting employee](images/deleteSuccess.png)

**Possible Error Output:**
* If there are multiple employees with the same name, all the matching employees would be displayed. Hence, ManaGease will return “Here is the list of the matching employees:”
  <br><img src="images/deleteSameName.png">
  <br><img src="images/deleteSameName1.png">

* Go back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Reading an employee's information: `read`

**What it does**

This feature allows users to view specific information **<ins>(except the name)</ins>** about an employee.

**Command Format**

`read INDEX PREFIX`

* Reads the employee's information specified by the `PREFIX` at the specified `INDEX`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div><br>

**Examples:**
* `read 1 /a` reads the address of the first employee in the most recently displayed list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Notes:**
Read command is extremely useful for leave tracking as the employee card only displays the promised annual leave of the employee. Use `read x /l` (where x is the index of the employee for whom you intend to check) to check the leave balance/leave taken to avoid errors before adding or deleting leaves.
</div> <br>

**Output:**

* ManaGease should display the information of the employee specified by the `INDEX` and `PREFIX`, if the input is valid.
  ![result for reading employee](images/readSuccess.png)

**Possible Error Output:**
* If the index is not within the numbers in the list, the app should display `The employee index provided is invalid`.
  
* If the command is incorrect, the app should display the following message.
  ![incorrect read command](images/incorrectReadCommand.png)
* If the `PREFIX` provided is not valid, the app should display `The field to read provided is invalid`. Please refer to the [parameter formats](#parameter-formats) for a list of all supported fields.

* Go back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding leave to an employee: `addleave`

**What it does**

This feature allows users to add leave(s) to an employee.

**Command Format**

`addleave INDEX /on DATE` or `addleave INDEX /from DATE /to DATE`


* Adds leave to the employee specified by the `INDEX`. 
* You have the flexibility to add leave for a single day or multiple consecutive days. 
* You can add leave for the current year and the upcoming year, but you won't be able to add leave for past dates.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
Please note that the sum of:
    (1)number of days of leave you are tyring to add, and
    (2)number of days the employee has been on leave
should not exceed the total number of days of leave allowed for an employee (displayed on the employee's person card).
To check (2), you may use the <a href="#view-an-employees-attendance-report-attendance"><code>attendance</code></a> command to see the number of days of leave the employee has been on.
</div>

* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div>

* The `DATE` must be in `DD/MM/YYYY` format, e.g. `01/01/2024`.
* For adding in multiple days of leave, the second `DATE` must be after the first `DATE`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tips!** <br>
Before adding leave, you can utilize the command `read x /l` (where x is the index of the employee for whom you intend to add leave) to check the leave balance. This ensures you avoid errors due to insufficient leave balance for the specified employee.
</div> <br>

**Examples:**
* `addleave 3 /on 01/01/2024` adds a single day of leave of `01/01/2024` to the third employee in the most recently displayed list.
* `addleave 3 /from 01/01/2024 /to 04/01/2024` adds in multiple days of leave to the third employee in the most recently displayed list from `01/01/2024` to `04/01/2024`, inclusive.

**Output:**
* If there are no errors, the app should display the following success message that the leave(s) has been added and display the number of leave left for the current year and the following year.
  <br>![result for successful addleave command](images/addLeaveSuccessMsg.png)
* Note that the `ANNUAL_LEAVE` field displayed on the employee card remains unchanged, as it represents the promised number of annual leave.

**Possible Error Output:**
* If the index is not within the numbers in the list, or the format of the command is incorrect, the app should display the following error message.
  <br>![result for incorrect addleave command](images/addLeaveInvalidIndexAndCommand.png)

* If the `DATE` provided is not in the correct format, the app should display the following error message.
  <br>![result for incorrect date format for addleave command](images/addLeaveInvalidDateFormat.png)

* If the `DATE` has already been added to the employee, the app should display the following error message.
  <br>![result for invalid leave for addleave command](images/addleaveInvalidLeave.png)

* If the second `DATE` is before the first `DATE` when adding in multiple days of leave, the app should display the following error message.
  <br>![result for invalid leave range for addleave command](images/addLeaveStartEndDateError.png)

* If any of the `DATE` is not in the current year or next year, or if the total number of days of leave added to an employee exceeds the total days of leave allowed for an employee, the app should display the following error message.
  <br>![result for invalid number of days of leave to add](images/addLeaveExceedLeavesOrNextYear.png)

* Go back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting leave from an employee: `deleteleave`

**What it does**

This feature allows users to delete leave(s) from an employee.

**Command Format**

`deleteleave INDEX /on DATE` or `deleteleave INDEX /from DATE /to DATE`

* Deletes leave from the employee specified by the `INDEX`.
* You have the flexibility to delete leave for a single day or multiple consecutive days.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed employee list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, and **must be within the range of the list (Total number of employees in the current list displayed)**.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Please do not use negative integers, non-integers and extremely large integers(integers greater than 2147483647) for the <code>INDEX</code>.
</div>

* The `DATE` must be in `DD/MM/YYYY` format, e.g. `01/01/2024`.
* For deleting multiple days of leave, the second `DATE` must be after the first `DATE`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tips!** <br>
Before deleting leave, you can utilize the command `read x /l` (where x is the index of the employee for whom you intend to delete leave) to verify that the leave taken matches the leave you wish to delete. This ensures you avoid errors due to insufficient leave balance for the specified employee.
</div>

**Examples:**
* `deleteleave 3 /on 01/01/2024` deletes a single day of leave of `01/01/2024` from the third employee in the most recently displayed list.
* `deleteleave 3 /from 01/01/2024 /to 04/01/2024` deletes multiple days of leave from the third employee in the most recently displayed list from `01/01/2024` to `04/01/2024`, inclusive.
