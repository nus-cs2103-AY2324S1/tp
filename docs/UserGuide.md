WellNUS is a *desktop application* used by **NUS Counsellors** to **manage and schedule appointments** with their student clients.

NUS counsellors have a hectic consultation schedule that constantly has to updated based on students' availability. This can lead to burnout due
to administrative task overload.

WellNUS eases this burden by providing a one-stop application for NUS counsellors to manage students' contact details and scheduling appointments.
It provides better visibility through neatly organized information, while preventing counsellors from making oversights like double booking a timeslot.

This user guide serves as a beginner-friendly (yet comprehensive!) walkthrough for all NUS counsellors on how to fully utilise the WellNUS application.
Our guide has three main components: 
1. Instructions on *downloading and setting up* the application
2. List of *available features*, and
3. Our *Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)*. Refer to the Table of Contents below to navigate to your area of interest.

If you are interested in more technical details, please refer to our [Developer Guide](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: 
WellNUS is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, WellNUS can get your contact management and scheduling tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME c/CONTACT_NUMBER`, `NAME` and `CONTACT_NUMBER` are parameters
  which can be used as `add n/John Doe c/98172645`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/RISK_LEVEL]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/low` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

#### 2.4.4 Saving the data

WellNUS data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### 2.4.5 Editing the data file

WellNUS data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/wellnus.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, WellNUS will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

The following scenarios will render the data file invalid:<br>

* File contains invalid or missing parameters, see `Parameter Constraints` under the [Command Format](#13-about-the-command-format) section<br>

* File contains duplicate `Students` and `Appointments`<br>

* File contains overlapping `Appointments`, or `Appointments` without a corresponding `Student`<br>

* File is not in proper JSON format, you may refer to [this guide](https://json.org/example.html)

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **How do I transfer my data to another Computer ?**<br/>
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous WellNUS home folder.

2. **How can I view my appointments scheduled today ?**<br/>
You can use the filter command with today's date. 
Here's an example: `filter 2023-12-07`. Replace `2023-12-07` with today's date in `yyyy-MM-dd` format.

3. **How do I clear all data in WellNUS ?**<br/>
To clear all data, use the `clear` command. This resets the storage, deleting all appointments and students. 
Exercise caution, as this action cannot be undone.

4. **How do I exit the WellNUS application ?**<br/>
To exit the program, use the `exit` command. This closes the application.

5. **I am unsure of a new student's risk level, what should I put ?**<br/>
If you're unsure of a new student's risk level, you can leave the risk level parameter blank when adding the student using the add command. 
WellNUS is designed to handle optional parameters. Here's an example:
`add n/John Doe c/98172645 a/821, Bishan, #02-124`
You can always update the risk level later using the tag command when more information becomes available.

## 4. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
