        <img src="images/jarDownload.png" alt="jarDownload"/> 
     </div>  
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_, such as the **Desktop** folder, for your NUSCoursemates. 
4. Open the command terminal in Step 1.
5. `cd` into the folder with the `NUSCoursemates.jar` file. For example, if your file is in the **Desktop** folder, simply type `cd Desktop`. 
6. Enter the next command, `java -jar NUSCoursemates.jar`. Your commands should look like this:
     <div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">

     </div>
8. **Absolutely well done!** You are now ready to move on to the next section to learn about the Command Line Interface (CLI).

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
**NUSCoursemates** uses the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary). CLI is a means of interacting with a computer program that runs on **text-based inputs** to execute different tasks.


Do not worry! CLI is definitely less scary than it sounds. In fact, this is all there is to it: 

<img src="images/CommandResult.png" alt="CommandResult"/>

Recall that the image above shows the [Command Box](#2-command-box) of **NUSCoursemates**. It is the _heart_ of **NUSCoursemates**. 

Therefore, it is no surprise that you will be keying in **commands**, which are text-based inputs, in the Command Box to execute different tasks.

The CLI offers several advantages, including:
* **Faster** and more **efficient** operation
* **Reduced memory usage** compared to non-CLI applications

However, to fully benefit from the advantages of the CLI, you will have to:
* Familiarise yourself with the various commands and their formats
* Ensure **accuracy** in spelling and formatting

Nevertheless, with this comprehensive user guide, you will be a proficient CLI user in no time.

While we know that you cannot wait to try out some exciting commands, let us learn about commands in the [Command Format](#command-format) section.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-tip">
**:bulb: Tips for CLI:**<br>
* As a SoC student, you will encounter the CLI in some SoC courses.
* Therefore, it is beneficial for you to start learning the CLI early!
</div>

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command Format

In the [previous section](#using-the-command-line-interface-cli), we learnt that commands must be spelt and formatted correctly.

In this section, let us explore the components that constitute a command in **NUSCoursemates**:

| Component    | Example    | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command word | `add`      | Specifies the task to be performed                                                                                                                              |
| Prefix       | `n/`       | Indicates the field to be edited (e.g., name)                                                                                                                   |
| Field        | `John Doe` | Represents the updated value or content. <br/> These values, which are provided by the user, are used to replace the `UPPER_CASE` letters in the command format |

Each feature has a unique command format composed of up to three components. The command format for each feature is explicitly described in the [Features](#features---managing-student-profiles) section below.

Using the format for `add` command as an example, we can deconstruct it into the three components:
 <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/CommandFormat2.png" alt="Command Format" width="650"/>
 </div> 

Additionally, notice how symbols surrounding the prefixes and fields are used to indicate additional properties for the respective fields.

For example (with reference to the `add` command above): 

| Symbol  | Description                                           | Example        | Interpretation                                    |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| None    | Compulsory field                                      | `n/NAME`       | The student's name is required                    |
| `[ ]`   | Optional field with a maximum of one entry            | `[e/EMAIL]`    | The student can have at most one email            |
| `[ ]…​` | Optional field with no limit on the number of entries | `[c/COURSE]…​` | The student can have a variable number of courses |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: More notes about the command format:**<br>

* Extraneous characters for commands made up of a command word only (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines! Space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

  c/del-MA1521` will cause an error, as the changes are read from left to right, and after the first delete, the 
  person no longer has the MA1521 available for the second delete.
* If such an error occur, an error message is displayed, and all changes in the chain of modifications will be 
  invalidated (none will be performed until the errors are fixed).

### Deleting a student : `delete`

> "It's really amazing when two strangers become the best of friends, but it's really sad when the best of friends become two strangers."
> — Unknown

In your journey with NUSCoursemates, you may find it necessary to part ways with a student entry in your NUSCoursemates. Maybe a friend has graduated or you've made an error. Whatever the reason, the delete command is your tool for decluttering and maintaining a neat NUSCoursemates.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in NUSCoursemates.
* `findstudent Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st student from the results of the `findstudent` command.

![delete student](images/deleteFeature.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

### Locating students by name: `findstudent`

When you're in search of specific details about a friend or coursemate, 
`findstudent` is your reliable command. Say goodbye to endless scrolling and let this feature 
guide you to your fellow NUS SoC students.

Format: `findstudent KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
* Case-Insensitivity: Inputting `john` or `JOHN`, you will find your friend John.
* Complete Words Matter: For accuracy, we search for complete words only. Searching `Han` won't match `Hans`, ensuring that you find exactly what you're looking for.
* Flexible Search: It’s like casting a wider net – enter `Hans Bo`, and you’ll catch any name that contains `Hans` or `Bo`.
* You can search `Hans Bo` it will still match `Bo Hans` ; we understand it's about the people, not the sequence.
</div>

### Sort
NUSCoursemates may get a little disorganised as you add more students. This is where the sorting feature comes to the rescue! 

There are numerous ways you can sort your NUSCoursemates, and these options are summarised here:

| Required Format | Description                                        | Special Notes                                                                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sort name`     | Sorts students by their **names**.                 | Students' names are sorted in alphabetical order (case-sensitive).                                 |
| `sort course`   | Sorts students by the **number of courses** taken. | Students with the same number of courses taken are arranged by their names alphabetically.         |
| `sort tags`     | Sort students by their **tags**.                   | If the student has multiple tags, only the tag with the greatest importance is taken into account. |

The details for each `sort` command are specified below. For seasoned users of NUSCoursemates, you can further customise the sorting criteria. Read on to learn more!

#### Sorting by Name: `sort name`
As time passes, you might encounter students with incredibly hard-to-spell names. You might vaguely recall the first letter of the name but struggle to spell it out completely.

Here's the good news: The `sort name` command neatly **arranges the students** in your NUSCoursemates application **by their names**, making it easier than ever to look up a student.

For seasoned users, you also have the flexibility to specify whether you would like to sort their names in **ascending** or **descending** order.

**Format:** `sort name` or `sort name-ascending`
* Sorts students by their names in the alphabetical order.

Examples:

| Before    | ![initial](images/BeforeSortName.png)  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **After** | ![sort_name](images/AfterSortName.png) |


Case-sensitivity is considered when sorting similar names. This table shows how similar names of different cases are sorted:

| Sorted Order |   Name    | Justification                                                                                 |
|:------------:|:---------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1 (Top)    |   john    | Lowercase letters come before uppercase letters. <br/> Therefore, 'john' precedes 'JOHN'.     |
|      2       |   JOHN    | Uppercase letters come after lowercase letters.                                               |
|      3       |  JOHN 1   | 'JOHN 1' is longer, so it comes after its prefix 'JOHN' (case sensitivity is not considered). |
|      4       |  JOhN 2   | Numbers are sorted in order, so '2' comes after '1'.                                          |
|      5       |  JOHN 2   | The third character, 'H', is an uppercase letter that comes after 'h' in 'JOhN 2'.            |
|      6       | john cena | The letters in the alphabet come after numbers.                                               |
|  7 (Bottom)  |   join    | As 'i' comes after 'h', 'join' comes after all names with 'h' as the third character.         |

**Format:** `sort name-descending` 
* Sorts students by their names in reverse alphabetical order. 
* The result is the reverse of entering the `sort name` command. 

Examples:

| Before    | ![initial](images/BeforeSortNameDescending.png)             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **After** | ![sort_name descending](images/AfterSortNameDescending.png) |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Be careful when typing names as the process of sorting names is case-sensitive!   

</div>

**Here's what you should do when you encounter an error:**

| Error Encountered         | Reason                                                                                                                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Invalid command format!` | You may have misspelled or entered the wrong sorting criterion. <br> Otherwise, you may have added extraneous characters in the command. | Verify that the criterion entered is spelt correctly in lowercase. <br> Ensure that you did not leave the hyphen out in `name-ascending` or `name-descending`. |

#### Sorting by Course: `sort course`

Do you need help in deciding which courses to take? Are you curious about who has taken on the most courses or who is just starting out?

The `sort course` command helps you rearrange your NUSCoursemates application by bringing those with the most courses to the top.

**Format:** `sort course` or `sort course size-descending`

Examples:

| Before    | ![initial](images/BeforeSorting.png)  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **After** | ![sort_course](images/SortCourse.png) |

For seasoned users looking to cheer on those just embarking on their academic journey, use `sort course size-ascending`. This flips the narrative, showcasing contacts with fewer courses in **ascending** order.

**Format:** `sort course size-ascending`
* Highlight the newcomers (those with the fewest courses), arranged in **ascending order**.

Examples:

| Before    | ![sort course before ascending](images/BeforeSortingAscending.png) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **After** | ![sort_course_size_ascending](images/SortCourseAscending.png)      |

In both cases, students with the same number of courses taken are arranged by their names similar to the [`sort name`](#sorting-by-name-sort-name) command.

**Here's what you should do when you encounter an error:**

| Error Encountered         | Reason                                                                                                                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Invalid command format!` | You may have misspelled or entered the wrong sorting criterion. <br> Otherwise, you may have added extraneous characters in the command. | Verify that the criterion entered is spelt correctly in lowercase. <br> Ensure that you did not leave the hyphen out in `size-ascending` or `size-descending`. |

#### Sorting by Tags: `sort tags`
The greatest joy in university is, without a doubt, to attend boring classes with your close friends.

With the `sort tags` command, NUSCoursemates helps you keep a _close_ track of students tagged as 'Close Friend' by placing them right at the top.

These will be followed by students tagged as 'Friend', 'Emergency', and those without tags.

**Format:** `sort tags`

Examples:

| Before    | ![initial](images/BeforeSortTags.png)  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **After** | ![sort tags](images/AfterSortTags.png) |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Students with multiple tags will be sorted by the tag with the greatest importance.  
For example, a student with both 'Friend' and 'Emergency' tags will be placed in NUSCoursemates with other students tagged as 'Friend'. 
</div>

**Here's what you should do when you encounter an error:**

| Error Encountered         | Reason                                                                                                                                     | Solution                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Invalid command format!` | You may have misspelled or entered the wrong sorting criterion, `tags`. <br> Otherwise, you may have added extraneous characters after it. | Verify that the command, `sort tags`, is spelt correctly in lowercase. <br> Unlike the other `sort` commands, no additional sorting criterion should be entered for `sort tags`. |

Please be patient with us as we work hard to bring you better sorting features!

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
