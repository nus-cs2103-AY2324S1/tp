### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" width="574" />

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands, and it also
displays the statistical information of how many developers and teams are there at the moment.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Team` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="574" />

The display in UI is depended on the `CommandResult` returned by Logic component.
For example, UI will have a **new window** for displaying "LinkTree" if command
`Tree` is received by the Logic component.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="574" />

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component:
* stores the addressbook and teambook date i.e., all `Person` objects and `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTeamList` respectively).
* maintains a filtered list of `Person`, `Team` objects and stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Team` objects (eg., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Team>` that can be observed.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This part is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, this means that model should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

<br>

### Storage component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/Storage.puml" width="450" />

The `Storage` component:
- Can save address book data, user preference data, and team book data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- Inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, and `TeamBookStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of them (if only the functionality of one is needed).
- Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

###  **Add a developer**

The `add` command implemented in the AddCommand class, allows users to add new developers to the addressbook. This command extends the`Command` class.


#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `add n/[Developer Name] p/[Phone Number] e/[Email] a/[Address] (OPTIONAL r/[Remark] t/Tags)`
- **Example**: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 r/likes to swim`
  - Adds a developer called John to the addressbook with the given details(provided there isn't already another developer with the same name).

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.



<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addPerson()`, so the `developer` will not be saved to `AddressBook`.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- AddCommandParser class parses the inputs and checks if the command format is given correctly. It throws an exception if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method in AddCommand class first checks if a developer with the specified name already exists in the addressbook. It throws an exception if this is true.
- Upon successful execution of the `execute` method, a message is displayed to the user confirming that a new developer has been added to the addressbook.

<br>

###  **Remove a developer**

The `delete` command implemented in the DeleteCommand class, allows users to remove developers from the addressbook. This command extends the`Command` class.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `delete [index]`
- **Example**: `delete 1`
  - Deletes a developer with the given index number.

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The index should be a postive integer. The command will succeed only if such a positive integer is a valid index in the addressbook.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- DeleteCommandParser class parses the inputs and checks if the command format is given correctly. It throws an exception if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method in DeleteCommand class first checks if the given index is valid. It throws an exception if this is false.
- After mapping the given index to the correct developer, checks are done to see if this developer is a teamleader of any team. If they are currently a teamleader, this developer cannot be deleted. An exception is thrown to notify the user of the same. The `Model#developerIsTeamLeader()` method carries out this check.
- The `execute` command also checks if this developer is part of any team. If yes, they are deleted from all such teams that they are a developer in. This is carried out by the `Model#removeDeveloperFromAllTeams()` method.
- Upon successful execution of the `execute` method, a message is displayed to the user confirming that the developer has been deleted, and also been removed from all teams(if any).

<br>

###  **Edit a developer**

The edit developer information feature is facilitated by the editCommand. It extends `Command` class.

#### Usage
- **Syntax**: `edit [DEVELOPER_INDEX] n/[NAME] p/[PHONE] e/[EMAIL] a/[ADDRESS] t/[TAG] ... t/[MORE_TAGS] `
- **Example**: `edit 1 n/Peter`
    - The first developer (with index 1) has changed his name to "Peter"

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** You do not need to provide the information fo the fields that
you do not want to change, which means if you only want to edit his name,
then providing new name is enough.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- editCommandParser class parses the inputs and checks if the command format
is given correctly. It throws an exception if there is no change between the
original developer information and the new information.
- The `execute` method in editCommand class create a new person object
with original Identity code as the edited person and then checks if
this edited person already exists in the addressbook. It throws an exception if this is true.
- Upon successful execution of the `execute` method, a message is
displayed to the user confirming that changes have been made to the
developer.


<br>

### **Find a developer**

#### Introduction
The `FindCommand` class, enables keyword-based searches for individuals. This intuitive command extends `Command` and utilizes `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

#### Usage
- **Syntax**: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`
- **Example**: `find Alice Bob`
  - Searches for entries containing 'Alice', 'Bob', or both.

##### Function implementation

- **Execution**: `FindCommand.execute` filters entries using the provided keywords and returns a `CommandResult` with the count of matches.
- **Filtering**: Uses `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` to identify matching entries based on names or descriptions.

##### Design and Functionality

- **Flexibility**: Supports partial keyword matching for broader search results, accommodating memory gaps or partial information.
- **User Experience**: Case-insensitive search enhances usability.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback for invalid inputs or no keyword scenarios.

##### Considerations

- **Search Methodology**:
- **Partial Keyword Matching**: Default choice for its user-friendly approach and broader match potential.



###  **List developers**

The list developers feature is facilitated by the ListCommand. It extends `Command` class.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

Case 1. The Ui is not displaying only the developer list, and uses the `list` command. In this case a list containing
only all existing developers but no teams will be displayed.

Case 2. The user has just used the `list` command, where the Ui is displaying the developer list already, and the user
uses `list` command again. The app will go back to displaying both lists of developers and teams.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** As long as the app is not displaying only the list of developers, the `list` command will toggle it to do so,
otherwise, the `list` command will toggle the app to display both lists of developers and teams.

</box>

#### Function Implementation
- ListCommand is executed.
- if the Ui is listing only developers already: MainWindow toggles the HBox containing both lists of developers and teams to
be visible; MainWindow toggles the HBox containing the list of teams to be invisible; Display both lists of developers
and teams;
- else if the Ui is listing not only teams: MainWindow toggles the HBox containing the list of teams to be visible; 
MainWindow toggles the HBox containing any other lists to be invisible; Display only the list of all existing teams;

<puml src="diagrams/ListCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>

<br>

###  **Create a new team**

The `newteam` command implemented in the AddTeamCommand class, allows users to create new teams which are added to the teambook. This command extends the`Command` class.


#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `newteam tn/[TEAMNAME] tl/[TeamLeader]`
- **Example**: `newteam tn/Test Team 1 tl/John`
  - Creates a new team called `Test Team 1` with `John` as the leader.

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addTeam()`, so the `team` will not be saved to `TeamBook`.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- The `AddTeamCommandParser` class parses inputs from the users and checks if the command is in the correct format. An exception is thrown if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method checks if the specified teamname has already been taken up by another team. If yes, an exception is thrown to indicate this. The `Model#hasTeam` does this check.
- The `execute` method also checks if a developer with the given name exists. If no such developer exists, an error message is displayed to indicate this. The `Model#containsPerson` does this check.
- If no exception is thrown, a new team with specified `teamname` is created and the developer with given name is set as `teamleader`. The `Model#addTeam` carries out this process.
- A message is displayed to the user to indicate that the team has been created. It can immediately be seen at the bottom of the TeamList in the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/AddTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="574" />


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where the team is stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the teams in a separate class called UniqueTeamList.
  * Pros: Better use of OOP.
  * Cons: Multiple layers of abstraction(through Model, TeamBook, UniqueTeamList).

* **Alternative 2:** Store the teams in the same class as Persons in the class AddressBook.
  * Pros: Easier implementation.
  * Cons: Breaks principle of abstraction and OOP. Information hiding is also not done.

<br>

###  **Add developers to an existing team**

The `dev2team` command implemented in the AddDevToTeamCommand class, allows users to add developers to an existing team in the teambook. This command extends the`Command` class.


#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `dev2team tn/[TEAMNAME] n/[Developer name]`
- **Example**: `dev2team tn/Test Team 1 tl/Jason`
  - Adds `Jason` to a team called `Test Team 1`

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addToTeam()`, so the specified `developer` will not be added to the `team`.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- The `AddDevToTeamParser` class parses inputs from the users and checks if the command is in the correct format. An exception is thrown if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method checks if the specified teamname is valid and exists in the teambook. If no, an exception is thrown to indicate this. The `Model#invalidAddToTeam` does this check.
- The `execute` method also checks if a developer with the given name exists. If no such developer exists, an error message is displayed to indicate this. The `Model#containsPerson` does this check.
- In addition, the `execute` method also checks if the given developer is already a teamleader in the same team or already exists as a developer in that team. In both cases, the `excecute` method will throw an exception indicating these scenarios. The `Model#personAlreadyInTeam` and `Model#isLeaderOfTeam` methods carry out these checks.
- If no exception is thrown, the developer is added to the team. This process is carried out by the `Model#addToTeam`
- A message is displayed to the user to indicate that the developer has been added to the team. The change can immediately be seen on the TeamBook part of the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/AddDevToTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>


#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: Can a team leader also be a developer in his team? :**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Team leader of a team cannot be added as a developer in his team.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the teams in the same class as Persons in the class AddressBook.
* Generally, though a team leader also works on the code that he is in charge of, adding himself as a developer in the team that he manages would be redundant. Hence we settled with this current design.

<br>

### **Remove an existing Team**
The `deleteteam` command implemented in the `DeleleteTeamCommand` class, allows users to delete an existing team from the teambook. This `DeleleteTeamCommand` class extends the abstract class `Command`. The operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteTeam()`.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `deleteteam tn/[TEAMNAME]`
- **Example**: `deleteteam tn/Test Team`
  - Deletes an existing team called `Test Team` from the teambook.

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#deleteTeam()`, so the `team` will not be deleted from `TeamBook`.

</box>

#### Function Implementation
- The `deleteTeamParser` class parses inputs from the users and checks if the command is in the correct format. An exception is thrown if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method checks if the specified teamname is valid and exists in the teambook. If no, an exception is thrown to indicate this. The `Model#hasTeam()` does this check.
- The `execute` method also checks if a developer with the given name exists. If no such developer exists, an error message is displayed to indicate this. The `Model#containsPerson` does this check.
- If no exception is thrown, the team will be deleted from the teambook. This process is carried out by the `Model#deleteTeam`
- A message is displayed to the user to indicate that the team has been deleted from the teambook. The change can immediately be seen on the TeamBook part of the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="500"/>

### Delete developers from an existing team
The `deletedev` command implemented in the DeleteDeveloperFromTeam class, allows the users to delete developers from an existing team in the teambook. This `DeleteDeveloperFromTeam` class extends the `Command` class in our implementation.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `deletedev tn/[TEAMNAME] n/[Developer name]`
- **Example**: `deletedev tn/Test Team 1 n/Jason`
  - Deletes `Jason` from a team called `Test Team 1`

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.

<box type="info" seamless>

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- The `DeleteDeveloperFromTeamParser` class parses inputs from the users and checks if the command is in the correct format. An exception is thrown if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method checks if the specified teamname is valid and exists in the teambook. If no, an exception is thrown to indicate this. The `Model#hasTeam` does this check.
- The `execute` method also checks if a developer with the given name exists in the addressbook. If no such developer exists, an error message is displayed to indicate this. The `Model#containsPerson` does this check.
- In addition, the `execute` method also checks if the given developer exists in the given team.If no such developer exists, the `excecute` method will throw an exception to indicate that scenario. The `Model#personAlreadyInTeam` method does this check.
- If no exception is thrown, you will get the IdentityCode of the developer using the `Model#getIdentityCodeByName()` method.
- Then the developer is deleted from the team. This process is carried out by the `Model#deleteDeveloperFromTeam()`
- A message is displayed to the user to indicate that the developer has been deleted from the team. The change can be seen immediately on the Team panel of the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteDeveloperFromTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>




### Edit team name of an existing team
The `editTeamName` command implemented in the editTeamNameCommand class, allows the users to edit the team name of an existing team in the teambook.
This editTeamNameCommand class extends the `Command` class in our implementation.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `editTeamName tn/[ORIGINAL_TEAMNAME] tn/[NEW_Developer name]`
- **Example**: `editTeamName tn/Test Team 1 tn/Test Team 2`
    - The team called `Test Team 1` is now changed its name to `Test Team 2`.

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, its team name will remain unchanged.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- The `EditTeamNameCommandParser` class parses inputs from the users and checks if the command is in the correct format. An exception is thrown if there is any format mismatch.
- The `execute` method checks if the specified team name is valid and exists in the teambook. If no, an exception is thrown to indicate this. The `Model#hasTeam` does this check.
- The `execute` method also checks if the new team name exists in the teambook. If a team already has this new name, an error message is displayed to indicate this. The `Model#hasTeam` does this check.
- In addition, the `execute` method also checks if the new team name
is the same as the original team name.If they are the same,
the `excecute` method will throw an exception to indicate that scenario.
- If no exception is thrown, the team name will be changed.
- A message is displayed to the user to indicate that the team name is changed. The change can be seen immediately on the Team panel of the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/EditTeamNameCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>







### Edit team leader of an existing team
The `editTeamLeader` command implemented in the editTeamLeaderCommand class, allows the users to edit the team leader of an existing team in the teambook.
This editTeamLeaderCommand class extends the `Command` class in our implementation.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

- **Command Syntax**: `editTeamLeader tn/[ORIGINAL_TEAMNAME] tl/[NEW_Developer name]`
- **Example**: `editTeamLeader tn/Test Team 1 tl/Bob`
    - The team called `Test Team 1` is now changed its leader to `Bob`.

LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, its team leader will remain unchanged.

</box>

#### Function Implementation

- The `EditTeamLeaderCommandParser` class parses inputs from the users and checks if the command is in the correct format. An exception is thrown if there is any format mismatch.

- In addition, the `execute` method also checks if the new team leader
  is the same as the original team leader.If they are the same,
  the `excecute` method will throw an exception to indicate that scenario.
- If no exception is thrown, the team leader will be changed.
- A message is displayed to the user to indicate that the team name is changed. The change can be seen immediately on the Team panel of the UI.

<puml src="diagrams/EditTeamLeaderCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>




### Find Team by Keywords

The `findteam` command, implemented in the `FindTeamCommand` class, allows users to search for teams using keywords. This command extends the `Command` class and uses `TeamContainsKeywordsPredicate` for keyword-based filtering.

#### Usage
- **Command Syntax**: `findteam KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`
- **Example**: `findteam alpha beta gamma`
    - Finds all teams whose names contain any of the specified keywords (case-insensitive).

#### Implementation Steps

##### Command Execution
- `FindTeamCommand.execute` uses `model.updateFilteredTeamList(predicate)` to filter teams and produces a `CommandResult` based on the number of matching teams.

##### Predicate for Filtering
- `TeamContainsKeywordsPredicate` checks if a team's name contains the specified keywords, utilized in `FindTeamCommand` for filtering.

#### Function Implementation

- **Handling No Keywords**: Throws `ParseException` when no keywords are provided, guiding users on correct usage.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Enhances user experience and search flexibility.
- **Partial vs. Full Match**: Allows partial matching for broader search results. Full match was considered but not implemented due to its restrictive nature.

1. **Parser Class Creation**: `FindTeamCommandParser` for parsing user input.
2. **Parse Method**: Parses input and handles the format of keywords.
3. **Command Class Specification**: `FindTeamCommand` with command word `findteam`.
4. **Execution Method**: Implements logic for filtering and displaying search results.
5. **Model Interaction**: Utilizes `Model#updateFilteredTeamList` and `Model#getFilteredTeamList`.

<puml src="diagrams/FindTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Search Methodology**
In designing the `findteam` command, two primary alternatives for matching team names with user-provided keywords were evaluated:

- **Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Partial Keyword Matching**
    - **Description**: Matches teams whose names contain the provided keywords as substrates, e.g., 'alpha' matches 'Alpha Team', 'Alphabeta', and 'Gamma Alpha'.
    - **Pros**:
        - **Broader Search Results**: Captures a wider range of potential matches.
        - **User-Friendly**: Accommodates partial information or memory gaps.
    - **Cons**:
        - **Over-Inclusive**: May return too many irrelevant results.
        - **Ambiguity**: Potential confusion with similar substrings in names.

- **Alternative 2: Full Keyword Matching**
    - **Description**: Requires an exact match between the keywords and the team names.
    - **Pros**:
        - **Precision**: Offers precise search results.
        - **Clarity**: Reduces ambiguity in the search results.
    - **Cons**:
        - **Restrictive**: Limits effectiveness for users who don't recall exact names.
        - **User Unfriendliness**: Requires exact input.



###  **List Teams**

The list teams feature is facilitated by the ListTeamCommand. It extends `Command` class.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

Case 1. The Ui is not displaying only the team list, and uses the `listt` command. In this case a list containing
only all existing teams but not list of developers will be displayed.

Case 2. The user has just used the `listt` command, where the Ui is displaying the team list already, and the user
uses `listt` command again. The app will go back to displaying both lists of developers and teams.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** As long as the app is not displaying only the list of teams, the `listt` command will toggle it to do so,
otherwise, the `listt` command will toggle the app to display both lists of developers and teams.

</box>

#### Function Implementation
- ListTeamCommand is executed.
- if the Ui is listing only teams already: MainWindow toggles the HBox containing both lists of developers and teams to
  be visible; MainWindow toggles the HBox containing the list of teams to be invisible; Display both lists of developers
  and teams;
- else if the Ui is listing not only teams: MainWindow toggles the HBox containing the list of teams to be visible;
  MainWindow toggles the HBox containing any other lists to be invisible; Display only the list of all existing teams;

<puml src="diagrams/ListTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="900"/>
<br>


###  **Show Tree**

The show tree feature is facilitated by the treeCommand. It extends `Command` class.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the function behaves at each step.

Case 1. The Ui is not displaying the tree. Used `tree` command to show the tree.

Case 2. The Ui is displaying the tree. Used `tree` command again to hide the tree.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**
* Any additional words provided after the command will be ignored.
(e.g. entering `tree list delete 1 HAHAHA-1234` is equivalent to entering `tree`)
* The project name **cannot be edited** because our application is designed to hold
  the contact information of all the developers in **one** software engineering project,
  the naming of this project is not important since there is only one project, and
  we do not need names to differentiate between different projects.
* The content in the tree **will not be updated in real time** because that requires
  too much computer resources. Instead, the tree is **updated every time you show it**.
  So, when you have some changes to the data, you should **hide the tree first if it is
  shown**, and call command `tree` again to show the tree. Then your changes will be
  reflected in the new tree. With that being said, if you enter command `tree` to
  show LinkTree and make some changes to the data, your changes will not be reflected
  in the current tree. You should hide the tree first and then call `tree` again to
  obtain a new tree which will reflect the changes you made.
* Team names and team leaders' names may not be shown fully if they are too long.
  You can refer back to the team list for their full names.


</box>

#### Function Implementation
- treeCommand is executed.
- if the Ui is not showing the tree: generate the tree and the tree will be shown in a new StackPane.
- else if the Ui is showing the tree: the StackPane will be hided and the tree is cleared. A new tree will
be generated next time showing the tree.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

### Overview


Our team managed to create this application LinkTree, which is designed to assist **project managers** and **developers** in startups. LinkTree aims to streamline team management, drawing inspiration from the existing AB3 features and introducing unique elements tailored to the needs of project managers and developers. The use of a distinctive tree structure allows startups to easily locate the right person at the right time.

### Challenges and Solutions:

We have made the following efforts to tackle the challenges we faced in this project. With constant discussion among our team members we managed to come with solutions for each problem.
1. **Modification of Storage Structure:**
    - **Challenge:** Initially, we encountered difficulties in modifying the storage structure to accommodate two JSON files - address book to manage developers and team book to manage the teams.
    - **Solution:** We conducted thorough research and discussions to design a storage system that efficiently separated the address book and team book data. Implementation involved understanding various UML diagrams, and AB3's implementation of addressbook.

2. **Integration of Team Management Features:**
    - **Challenge:** Adapting the existing AB3 features, such as `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `find`, and `list`, to incorporate our team management implementation posed a significant challenge.
    - **Solution:** Through collaborative efforts, we systematically modified each feature to support team-related functionalities. This involved adjusting data manipulation logic, modifying diagrams, and providing new user interfaces for team-related operations.

3. **Upgrading the User Interface:**
    - **Challenge:** Changing the existing UI to display the details of team members was another challenge that we encounterd in this project.
    - **Solution:** We have decided to create a new panel beside developers panel to display the team name, team leader name and developer names in the team.

4. **Design and Implementation of Tree Structure:**
    - **Challenge:** Designing the tree structure for effective team hierarchy was a conceptual challenge. The practical implementation proved more complex than anticipated.
    - **Solution:** After finalizing the conceptual design, we engaged in iterative development and testing. Refinements were made to the implementation based on feedback, resulting in a simple tree structure that displays all the developers and teams in the addressbook and teambook.

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
    - **Challenge:** The final stages of testing and documentation required meticulous attention to detail and comprehensive coverage.
    - **Solution:** We established a comprehensive testing framework, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing to maximise our test coverage. Documentation was created concurrently with development, ensuring that each feature, modification, and usage scenario was well-documented for our target users.

### Results and Achievements

1. **Timely Feature Implementation:** All planned features, including the innovative tree structure, were successfully implemented within the given deadline.

2. **Effective Tree Structure and UI Implementation:** The implementation of the unique tree structure proved to be a success and  providing an intuitive UI was one of the efficient way to manage teams within the application.

3. **Testing Process:** We have done enough testing procedures to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. This included unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing that we have learnt CS2103T.

## **Appendix D: Future Enhancements**
**We have several feature enhancements and quality of life improvements in the pipeline.**
**Some of them are as follows:**

1. Currently, a new person can be added to the addressbook if they have the same phone number of email as another existing person. We plan to fix this in a future release to make sure that persons with the same phone number/email as an existing person cannot be added even if they have a different name.
2. Currently, when the tree is displayed, if there are not enough teams to display to fill the windows, a white background fills up the empty space by default. This will be patched in a future release so that the empty space will carry the same default colour as the UI.
3. Currently, when the tree is actively being displayed, it does not get refreshed when commands are run. For example, when a new developer is added to the addressbook, it does not reflect on the tree even though there is a feedback in the UI stating success. The tree gets refreshed only upon closing and reopening the tree. The auto-refresh feature will be implemented in a future release.
4. When `delete 0` command is run, the command error stating `invalid command format` is too general. Even though it specifies that the index has to be a positive integer, we can change it in the future to give better information to specify that the index number has to be positive. So when typing this command, the new error would be like `Index provided is incorrect. It has to be a positive integer. Please try again.`
5. Currently, the `help` command displays some of the most commonly used commands and their formats. Some commands like `findteam` and `hi` are not mentioned here. A future version of LinkTree will have a more comprehensive command summary page that will include all the valid commands and their formats.
