### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Implementation of patient commands

### Find patient by illness feature

[FindIllnessCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/billieboy7/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/personparser/FindIllnessCommandParser.java
[FindIllnessCommand.java]: https://github.com/billieboy7/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/personcommands/FindIllnessCommand.java

#### Implementation

For _Find Illness_ command, the noteworthy classes are:

- `LogicManager.java` - Calls the address book parser. 
- `AddressBookParser.java` - For passing the arguments to `FindIllnessCommandParser`.
- [`FindIllnessCommandParser.java`][FindIllnessCommandParser.java] - For passing the arguments to `FindIllnessCommand`.
- [`FindIllnessCommand.java`][FindIllnessCommand.java] - For execution of the find illness command.

Let's take a valid user input, `find-i flu`, as an example. 

-- user input: `find-i flu` --  
Step 1. Logic Manager parses the user input through the AddressBookParser. 

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. AddressBookParser identifies the command word `find-i`.  
Step 3. Returns FindIllnessCommandParser().parse(arguments) (in this case arguments = `flu`)

-- `FindIllnessCommandParser` --  
Step 4. FindIllnessCommandParser takes in arguments (`flu`) and uses the arguments to create the IllnessContainsKeywordsPredicate object.  
Step 5. Returns a FindIllnessCommand object which takes in the IllnessContainsKeywordsPredicate object as a parameter.

-- `FindIllnessCommand` --  
Step 6. The IllnessContainsKeywordsPredicate object is saved in the FindIllnessCommand object. 

-- `LogicManager` --  
Step 7. The FindIllnessCommand object is returned and its execute(model) method is triggered.   
Step 8. The filtered person list in the model is updated using the IllnessContainsKeywordPredicate.   
Step 9. Returns a CommandResult which then leads to the updated filtered person list to be displayed.   

The following sequence diagram shows how the find patient by illness operation works:

![FindIllnessCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindIllnessCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Implementation of appointments commands

The following diagram shows the overview of a generic appointment command `AppointmentXYZCommand` and the associated classes.
The generic appointment command can be `Schedule`, `Reschedule`, etc..

![AppointmentCommandClassDiagram](images/AppointmentCommandClassDiagram.png)

### View all appointments feature

#### Implementation

For _Appointments_ command, the noteworthy class is:
- `AppointmentsCommand.java` - For execution of the view all appointments command.

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes appointments command to view all appointments.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `AppointmentsCommand`

-- `AppointmentsCommand` --  
Step 3. Shows all appointments.

The following activity diagram shows how the view appointments operation works:

![AppointmentsCommandActivityDiagram](images/AppointmentsCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Cancel feature

#### Implementation

For _Cancel_ command, the noteworthy classes are:

- `CancelCommandParser.java` - For passing the arguments to `CancelCommand`.
- `CancelCommand.java` - For execution of the cancel appointment command.

The following exceptions may be thrown during this process, namely:

- ParseException for invalid index format
- CommandException for index out of range
  
-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes cancel command with a valid appointment index.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `CancelCommandParser`.

-- `CancelCommandParser` --   
Step 3. Verify that the index is correct.  
Step 4. Returns new `CancelCommand`.

-- `CancelCommand` --  
Step 5. Verify that the index is not out of range in the appointments list.  
Step 6. Appointment is cancelled and deleted from the appointments list.

The following activity diagram shows how the cancel operation works:

![CancelCommandActivityDiagram](images/CancelCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Schedule feature 

[ScheduleCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/appointmentparser/ScheduleCommandParser.java
[ScheduleCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/appointmentcommands/ScheduleCommand.java

#### Implementation

The implementation of the schedule feature is similar to the implementation for adding a patient. The Schedule command 
takes in an _Appointment object_ (containing the Start Time, End Time and Appointment Description) and _Name object_ 
(containing the name of the patient for whom the appointment is booked). 

For _Schedule_ command, the noteworthy classes are:
- [`ScheduleCommandParser.java`][ScheduleCommandParser.java] - For parsing the arguments to `ScheduleCommand`.
- [`ScheduleCommand.java`][ScheduleCommand.java] - For execution.

The following exceptions may be thrown during this process, namely:
- ParseException for missing arguments
- ParseException for invalid arguments
- ParseException for Appointment Start Time after Appointment End Time
- CommandException for creating appointments for patients not in MediFlowR's records
- CommandException for identical appointments
- CommandException for appointments with clashing timeslots

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes schedule command by starting command with the 'schedule' keyword, followed by 
correct and valid arguments.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `ScheduleCommandParser`.

-- `ScheduleCommandParser` --   
Step 3. Verify that all argument prefixes are present and that no duplicates exist.  
Step 4. Verify that provided arguments are valid.     
Step 5. Returns new `ScheduleCommand`.

-- `ScheduleCommand` --   
Step 6. Verify that the patient for whom the Appointment is created exists in MediFlowR's records.   
Step 7. Verify that the Appointment Start Time appears before the Appointment End Time.  
Step 8. Verify that the same appointment has not already been added.  
Step 9. Verify that the new appointment to be added does not have time conflict with another appointment on the 
same day.  
Step 10. Appointment is scheduled. 


The following activity diagram shows how the schedule operation works:

![ScheduleCommandActivityDiagram](images/ScheduleCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
1. We decided to make the Schedule Feature case-sensitive. The patient name provided by the user must match the patient name in MediFlowR's
records (even case sensitivity). The rationale is as such:
   * Currently, in our application, it is possible for 2 patients to be created with names 'John Doe' and 'John doe'. 
A case-insensitive Schedule command for 'John Doe' will cause a conflict. Thus, we have mandated that for the Schedule Feature, 
the patient name have an exact match with the patient name in our database. This also reduces the chances of the user accidentally
scheduling an appointment for the wrong patient but ensuring that the user conscientiously schedules an appointment for the specific patient.


### Reschedule feature

[RescheduleCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/appointmentparser/RescheduleCommandParser.java
[RescheduleCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/appointmentcommands/RescheduleCommand.java

#### Implementation

For _Reschedule_ command, the noteworthy classes are:
- [`RescheduleCommandParser.java`][RescheduleCommandParser.java] - For parsing the arguments to `RescheduleCommand`.
- [`RescheduleCommand.java`][RescheduleCommand.java] - For execution.

The following exceptions may be thrown during this process, namely:
- ParseException for missing arguments
- ParseException for invalid arguments
- CommandException for index out of range
- CommandException for identical appointments
- CommandException for appointments with clashing timeslots

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes reschedule command with correct and valid arguments.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `RescheduleCommandParser`.

-- `RescheduleCommandParser` --  
Step 3. Verify that all argument prefixes are present.  
Step 4. Verify that provided arguments are valid.  
Step 5. Returns new `RescheduleCommand`.  

-- `RescheduleCommand` --  
Step 6. Verify that the given index exist in UniqueAppointmentList.  
Step 7. Verify that the new appointment to be added does not have time conflict with another appointment on the same day.  
Step 8. Verify that the same appointment has not already been added.  
Step 9. Appointment is rescheduled.  

The following activity diagram shows how the reschedule operation works:

![RescheduleCommandActivityDiagram](images/RescheduleCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Find patient appointments feature

[FindAppointmentCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/appointmentparser/FindAppointmentCommandParser.java
[FindAppointmentCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/appointmentcommands/FindAppointmentCommand.java

#### Implementation

For _FindAppointment_ command, the noteworthy classes involved are:

- `LogicManager.java` - Calls the address book parser.

- `AddressBookParser.java` - For passing the arguments to `FindAppointmentCommandParser`.

- [`FindAppointmentCommandParser.java`][FindAppointmentCommandParser.java] - This parses the user input, checks for its validity and creates a new `FindAppointmentCommand` object.

- [`FindAppointmentCommand.java`][FindAppointmentCommand.java] - This command object executes to update the filtered appointments list to show all appointments that is tagged to a patient whose named is specified through the keyword. 

Let's take a valid user input, `find-a John`, as an example.

-- user input: `find-a John` --  
Step 1. Logic Manager parses the user input through the AddressBookParser.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. AddressBookParser identifies the command word `find-a`.  
Step 3. Returns FindAppointmentCommandParser().parse(arguments) (in this case arguments = `John`)

-- `FindAppointmentCommandParser` --  
Step 4. FindAppointmentCommandParser takes in arguments (`John`) and uses the arguments to create the PatientContainsKeywordsPredicate object.  
Step 5. Returns a FindAppointmentCommand object which takes in the PatientContainsKeywordsPredicate object as a parameter.

-- `FindAppointmentCommand` --  
Step 6. The PatientContainsKeywordsPredicate object is saved in the FindAppointmentCommand object.

-- `LogicManager` --  
Step 7. The FindAppointmentCommand object is returned and its execute(model) method is triggered.   
Step 8. The filtered appointment list in the model is updated using the PatientContainsKeywordsPredicate.   
Step 9. Returns a CommandResult which then leads to the updated filtered appointment list to be displayed.


Note: 
1) Multiple keywords, denoted by a space, can be used. 
2) Patient name must be an exact match to any one of the keywords keyed into the program (CASE-INSENSITIVE). 

The following sequence diagram shows how the find appointment command works:

![FindAppointmentCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindAppointmentCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Display upcoming appointments feature

[UpcomingCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/appointmentparser/UpcomingCommandParser.java
[UpcomingCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/appointmentcommands/UpcomingCommand.java

#### Implementation

For _Upcoming_ command, the noteworthy classes involved are:

- [`UpcomingCommandParser.java`][UpcomingCommandParser.java] - This parses the user input and creates a new `UpcomingCommand` object.

- [`UpcomingCommand.java`][UpcomingCommand.java] - This command object executes to update the filtered appointments list to show all upcoming appointments (appointments after the current time) in the application.

The feature is implemented by updating the filtered appointment list stored in the model with a predicate that will only display
appointments with start date times after the current date time.

The following sequence diagram shows how the upcoming command works:

![UpcomingCommandSequenceDiagram](images/UpcomingCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Sort patients/appointment features

[SortPatientCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/personparser/SortPatientCommandParser.java
[SortPatientCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/personcommands/SortPatientCommand.java
[SortCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/appointmentparser/SortCommandParser.java
[SortCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/appointmentcommands/SortCommand.java

#### Implementation

For _sort-p_ and _sort-a_ commands, the noteworthy classes involved are:

- [`SortPatientCommandParser.java`][SortPatientCommandParser.java] - This parses the user input and creates a new `SortPatientCommand` object.  
- [`SortPatientCommand.java`][SortPatientCommand.java] - This command object executes to sort the patient list by ascending or descending order and by the given attribute to sort by.
- [`SortCommandParser.java`][SortCommandParser.java] - This parses the user input and creates a new `SortCommand` object.
- [`SortCommand.java`][SortCommand.java] - This command object executes to sort the appointment list by ascending or descending order and by the given attribute to sort by.

The following exceptions may be thrown during this process, namely:
- ParseException for missing arguments
- ParseException for invalid arguments

The feature is implemented by sorting the unfiltered patient/appointment list stored in the model with using a custom comparator depending on each attribute.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort-p/sort-a mechanism behaves at each step.

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes sort-p/sort-a command with correct and valid arguments.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `SortPatientCommandParser`/`SortCommandParser`.

-- `SortPatientCommandParser`/`SortCommandParser` --  
Step 3. Verify that all argument prefixes are present.  
Step 4. Verify that provided arguments are valid.  
Step 5. Returns new `SortPatientCommand`/`SortCommand`.

-- `SortPatientCommand`/`SortCommand` --  
Step 6. Patient/Appointment list is sorted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort patient command works:

![SortPatientCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortPatientCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
1. We decided to implement the comparator for names to compare the names after the names have been converted to lower case. This is as we want it to be sorted in that order, where john doe is considered smaller than Kevin Porter Jr.
2. We eventually want to sort from distance from the current location of the machine so we made the attributes easily expandable for future support.

#### Additional Info:
1. The sort command under appointments is implemented similarly but sorts the appointment list either by priority or time.

### Diagnose/Undiagnose Feature

[DiagnoseCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/personparser/DiagnoseCommandParser.java
[DiagnoseCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/personcommands/DiagnoseCommand.java
[UndiagnoseCommandParser.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/personparser/UndiagnoseCommandParser.java
[UndiagnoseCommand.java]: https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/personcommands/UndiagnoseCommand.java

#### Implementation

For _Diagnose/Undiagnose_ command, the noteworthy classes are:

- [`DiagnoseCommand.java`][DiagnoseCommand.java] - For execution.
- [`UndiagnoseCommand.java`][UndiagnoseCommand.java] - For execution.

The following exceptions may be thrown during this process, namely:
- ParseException for missing arguments
- ParseException for invalid arguments
- CommandException for invalid index

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the diagnose mechanism behaves at each step.

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes diagnose command with correct and valid arguments.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `DiagnoseCommandParser`.

-- `DiagnoseCommandParser` --  
Step 3. Verify that all argument prefixes are present.  
Step 4. Verify that provided arguments are valid.  
Step 5. Calls ParserUtil#parseIllnesses() to create the set of illnesses.  
Step 6. Returns new `DiagnoseCommand`.

-- `DiagnoseCommand` --  
Step 7. Calls DiagnoseCommand#createDiagnosedPerson() to add the set of illnesses to the patients existing set of illnesses.  
Step 8. Check which illnesses were already inside to feedback to user.  
Step 9. Patient is diagnosed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undiagnose mechanism behaves at each step.

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes undiagnose command with correct and valid arguments.

-- `AddressBookParser` --  
Step 2. Returns new `UndiagnoseCommandParser`.

-- `UndiagnoseCommandParser` --  
Step 3. Verify that all argument prefixes are present.  
Step 4. Verify that provided arguments are valid.  
Step 5. Calls ParserUtil#parseIllnesses() to create the set of illnesses.  
Step 6. Returns new `UndiagnoseCommand`.

-- `UndiagnoseCommand` --  
Step 7. Calls UndiagnoseCommand#createUndiagnosedPerson() to remove the set of illnesses to the patients existing set of illnesses.  
Step 8. Check which illnesses were never inside to feedback to user.  
Step 9. Patient is undiagnosed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the diagnose patient command works:

![DiagnoseCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DiagnoseCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo/Redo Feature

![UndoCommandSequenceDiagram](images/UndoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following exceptions may be thrown during this process, namely:
- ParseException for additional arguments with undo/redo command
- CommandException for attempting to execute undo when there is no command to undo
- CommandException for attempting to execute redo when there is no undone command to redo

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the _Undo_ command executes.

-- user input --  
Step 1. User executes a valid `add` command.

-- `AddCommand` --  
Step 2. Adds the `add` command as recent command.  
Step 3. Adds the added `person` as new patient.

Step 4. User executes `undo` command.

-- `UndoCommand` --  
Step 5. Verify that there is a command to undo.  
Step 6. Undo the most recent command (deletes the new patient).  

-- `RedoCommand` --  
Step 7. Verify that there is an undone command to undo.  
Step 8. Redo the most recent undone command (restores the deleted patient).  

The execution can be seen in the activity diagram given below.

_Activity Diagram for a typical `undo` command_
![UndoCommandActivityDiagram.png](images/UndoCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:
1. undoHistory and redoHistory are implemented with stacks as the behavior of always operating on the most recent action is consistent with the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature of a stack.
2. Although storing the state of the program after every user action is not memory efficient, our test runs revealed that the memory usage was insignificant and thus this design can be safely implemented.
3. The undo/redo commands does not support the following commands: `appointments`, `find`, `today`, `upcoming`, `find-i`, `find-p`, `patients`, `exit`, `help` and `list`. The rationale is as such:
    * The `find`, `today` and `upcoming` commands can be undone by the `appointments` and `list` command and vice versa.
    * The `find-i` and `find-p` commands can be undone by the `patients` and `list` vice versa.
    * The `exit` and `help` commands do not operate on the data, hence there is no need for them to be undone

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
Healthcare Professionals who

* have a need to manage a significant number of patients at any given time
* can add, update, delete and search patient records
* are required to update, access and track multiple patients' treatment history
* manage the scheduling, rescheduling and cancelling of appointments
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing to mouse interactions
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage patients' medical records faster than a typical GUI driven app in a systematic manner

       **Expected**: The most recent data-changing command is undone. The application's state reverts to before the command was executed.

2. Undoing a command that does not change data

    1. Prerequisites: Perform a command that does not change data, such as `find`, `today`, `upcoming`, `find-i`, `find-p`, `patients`, `exit`, `help`, or `list`.
    2. Execute the command: `undo`  

       **Expected**: No changes occur. An appropriate message indicating that the command cannot be undone is displayed.

### Redoing a command

1. Redoing a previously undone command

    1. Prerequisites: Perform an `undo` operation.
    2. Execute the command: `redo`  

       **Expected**: The previously undone command is redone. The application's state updates to reflect the redone command.

2. Redoing a command without an `undo`

    1. Prerequisites: Without having used `undo`, attempt to `redo`.
    2. Execute the command: `redo`  

       **Expected**: No changes occur. An appropriate message indicating that there is no command to redo is displayed.

### Listing all records

1. Displaying all patient records and appointments

   1. Execute the command: `list`  

      **Expected**: All patient records and all appointments are displayed.

### Clearing all records

1. Clearing all patient records and appointments

    1. Execute the command: `clear`  

       **Expected**: All patient records and appointments are cleared from the application.

### Toggling dark/light mode

1. Toggling between dark and light modes

    1. Execute the command: `mode`  

       **Expected**: The application's theme toggles between dark and light mode.

### Exiting the program

1. Exiting the program

    1. Execute the command: `exit`  

       **Expected**: The application closes.

### Viewing help

1. Viewing help information

    1. Execute the command: `help`  

       **Expected**: Help information is displayed, explaining how to access the help page.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. The current success message after executing an undo or redo command is `Undo Successful.` or `Redo Successful.`, but
this is too general and does not provide any useful information. We plan to add the exact command that was undone or redone
to the success message so that the user knows exactly what command was undone or redone.

2. Currently, after scheduling an appointment for a patient, the user is not able to change the description of the appointment.
We plan to change the triage command so that it will allow the user to change the appointment description.

3. Currently, patients with the same name but with different casing, i.e. same letters but different in uppercase/lowercase,
can be added to the patient records. However, that can be very confusing for users, especially if they had accidentally added
a duplicate patient into the records but with a different casing for the patient name. We plan to make the checking for any
duplicates in patient names case-insensitive so that this will no longer be an issue.

4. Currently, illnesses with the same name but with different casing, i.e. same letters but different in uppercase/lowercase,
can be added to the same patient. However, that can be very confusing for users, especially if they had accidentally added
a duplicate illness to the same patient but with a different casing for the illness name. We plan to make the checking for any
duplicates in illness names case-insensitive so that this will no longer be an issue.

5. Currently, gender can only be `MALE` or `FEMALE`, and the input has to match the words exactly, meaning that the input has to
be uppercase. However, in order to optimise for fast typists, we plan to treat the gender attribute as case-insensitive, so that
any input that is either `male` or `female` will be accepted without worrying about the casing.

6. Currently, a patient's birthdate can be set after the current date that the command is executed on. For example, `2023/10/20`
can be added as a patient's birthdate even though the current date might be `2023/08/08`. We plan to add a validation for birthdates
such that birthdates after the current date will not be considered a valid birthdate.

7. Currently, the find command only is able to find by name. We plan to add the functionality to find anything that 
matches the given conditions that could be other variables of a patient or appointment such as range of birthdays.

8. Currently, patients with the same name but different amount of spacings, e.g. `John Doe` and `John  Doe` with 2 spaces,
are allowed to be added into the application. We plan to add a validation that will ignore extra spaces when checking for duplicate names.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level 

MediFlowR is a brown-field project that has been inspired from and based upon AB3. We have modified AB3's existing 
model, Person, to accommodate our Patient records management. Moreover, we have extended the Person model to create 
an Appointments model to keep track of the appointments scheduled for the patients. Having 2 models (Person and 
Appointment) in MediFlowR that interact with each other has made it more complex than AB3. Moreover, we have incorporated
Priority Tags into the Appointments model which allows for triaging (sorting) of the appointments. The Appointment model
brings additional complexity to the project while also improving its functionality by facilitating interaction between
both models. 

### Challenges

During the initial phase, understanding the codebase was difficult as we were not familiar with it. There were multiple
dependencies and layers of abstraction which made it difficult to understand the flow of the project. As time went by,
we became more adept at understanding the underlying mechanism to tweak the program and finding bugs in the AB3 program.
As we added more functionalities, more dependencies were introduced and the program became increasingly complicated. In
light of that we focussed on developing a user-centric, intuitive interface that is direct. For example, under a healthcare system's
standpoint, we wanted to include a variety of ways for users to search for information (through patient name, illness, today's appointments, etc.). The command words used were designed in a way that the user had to conscientiously specify the way they intended to search.
