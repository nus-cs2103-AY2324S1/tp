### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the current address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the history of address book data in `AddressBookList`.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The implementation involves creating an `AddressBookList` class which extends from `ArrayList<AddressBook>` to store the history of `AddressBook`.
`AddressBookList` also stores an integer `index` as a pointer to the current `AddressBook` and an `ArrayList<String>` of commands input by the user called `pastCommands`.

Whenever `AddressBook` is changed, it will store its copy and append it to the `AddressBookList`, increment `index` by 1, and append the command
that modifies the `AddressBook` to `pastCommands`.

When `AddressBookList#undo()` is called, the current `AddressBook` changes to `AddressBookList.get(index - 1)` and `index` is decremented by 1.
If the current `index` is at 0, `AddressBookList` will throw an error stating there is no command to undo.

If, after undoing some command, the user decides to modify the `AddressBook` with new commands, `AddressBookList` will overwrite all `AddressBook` after that particular state.
For example, currently `AddressBookList` has 10 `AddressBook` in it, and the current state is at `AddressBookList.get(5)`. Then, the user adds an employee. All `AddressBook` 
at index 6 to 9 will be deleted, and `AddressBookList.get(6)` will now contain the new `AddressBook` that has the new employee in it.

When `AddressBookList#redo()` is called, the current `AddressBook` changes to `AddressBookList.get(index + 1)` and `index` is incremented by 1.
If the current `index` is at `AddressBookList.size() - 1`, `AddressBookList` will throw an error stating there is no command to redo.

`AddressBookList` sits in `ModelManager` class where it will be modified whenever `ModelManager#addPerson()`, `ModelManager#deletePerson()`, and `ModelManager#setPerson()`
are called, i.e., whenever `AddressBook` is changed. `ModelManager#undo()` will call `AddressBookList#undo()` and `ModelManager#redo()` will call `AddressBookList#redo()`.

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

![RedoSequenceDiagram](images/RedoSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Undo/Redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Stores only the changes between address book versions. For example, only store the employee being added when the user adds an employee.
  * Pros: Less memory.
  * Cons: More complications on the logic side: undoing `add` = `delete`, undoing `clear` = `add` back all employees, etc.

### Export Data Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed export mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. Additionally, the operation is exposed in the Model interface which allows users to perform `filter` operation to discard selected portions of the Model interface before exporting.

The primary operations that aid in this mechanism are:
* `getFilteredPersonList()` -- Used in conjunction with `filter` operation so that the model will display the latest Persons of interest.
* `generateListPeople()` -- Performs extracting of Person objects from the latest model and obtaining the Person's attributes.
* `generateFile()` -- Creates a directory for exported CSVs and a File object containing the filename imposed by the user.
* `convertToCsv()`-- Performs writing of Person's attributes into the created File Object in `generateFile()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The initial address book state will display all the employees.

Step 2. The user executes `list d/Engineering` command which filters employees belonging to the Engineering department. This command also executes `getFilteredPersonList()` that alters the Model by containing only the filtered Person list.

Step 3. The user executes `export engineering_dept` command which takes the "altered" Model containing filtered Person objects and executes `generateListPeople()` which helps to obtain Person objects from the currentModel and extracting their attributes into a list.

Step 4. After completion of step 3 and still in the `export engineering_dept` command, `generateFile()` and `convertToCsv()` are called sequentially to allow writing of Person' attributes into the exported CSV file.

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user attempts to export the current employees' data:

<img src="images/ExportActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How exports executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User specifies filename and file is stored in fixed location.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Easy for user to find his newly exported file.
    * Cons: Doesn't provide user a view on whether the filename has already been used. Loss of file is a concern.

* **Alternative 2:** Full flexibility for user to select the exported location of one's files.
    * Pros: User can perform better categorisation of data according to organisation's needs.
    * Cons: Harder to implement since program needs to know which locations are out-of-bounds. Example: src files.




### Leave Feature

#### Implementation

This feature adds a way to record and view registered leaves for the employees.
This is implemented by adding a `Leave` class as an attribute to `Person` class.
Manipulating the leave records can be done using `Command#LeaveCommand` and viewing can be done using `Commmand#ViewLeaveCommand`.
ViewLeaveCommand can be invoked with or without parameter.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the birthday mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2: The user executes `view_leave` to see the currently registered leaves of the employees.
This function works like a filter through the `model`. This is done by having a predicate to test if the person has a leave.
For the default no-parameter `view_leave` function, this will invoke the creation of `HasLeaveAnyMonthPredicate` predicate, which tests if the employees have leaves in any of the months. The command goes through the `ViewLeaveCommandParser` class to check if there is any parameters.
This command will return a list of employees who has leave in any of the months by invoking a `model.updateFilteredPersonsList(predicate)`.

Step 3: The user adds and removes leaves from employees by doing a `leave 2 m/1,-2`
This command will go through the `LeaveCommandParser` class. The parser will then extract the relevant information, like the employee's index and the months to add or remove. This command adds a leave in January and removes a leave in February for the employee on index 2.

Step 4: The user wants to see the employees with leaves in January or February in the Engineering department by doing a `view_leave m/1,2 d/engineering`
This works similarly to the default `view_leave` but with parameters. The `ViewLeaveCommandParser` will parse the command and combine the predicates as it parses the arguments.
In this case, the `ViewLeaveCommandParser` will create `HasLeaveThisMonthPredicate` and `MatchingDepartmentPredicate`.
For every month specified, the parser will create a `HasLeaveThisMonthPredicate` and do an `or()` operation of the predicate, resulting in a `combinedPredicate` variable. The parser will also create a `MatchingDepartmentPredicate` and do an `and()` to the combinedPredicate().
This `combinedPredicate` will then be passed to the `ViewLeaveCommand` constructor, which will create a `ViewLeaveCommand` that filters the `model` using the `combinedPredicate` specified. 

The sequence diagram below shows how the `leave` commands execute:
<img src="images/LeaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

The sequence diagram below shows how the `view_leave` commands execute:
<img src="images/ViewLeaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Leave executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can add and remove leaves at the same time for one employee.
    * Pros: User can add and remove multiple leaves faster than doing it one by one.
    * Cons: Might be confusing to the user at first, the expected format needs to be properly explained.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allows one addition/removal at a time.
    * Pros: Straightforward and intuitive for the users to understand.
    * Cons: Takes longer for the user to add or remove multiple leaves for the same employee.

**Aspect: How View Leave executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can view leaves for multiple months at once.
    * Pros: The user can view all the employees with leaves in any of the specified months at once when the use case allows.
    * Cons: Might be confusing to the user at first, the expected format needs to be properly explained. For example, it might be confusing whether the relationship between the months is an "and" or an "or". In this implementation, it is an "or", meaning it will show employees having leave(s) in any of the months instead of all of the months.

* **Alternative 2:** Only allows users to view one leave month at a time.
    * Pros: Straightforward and intuitive for the users to understand.
    * Cons: There might be use cases where the user needs to compare and see different months at once.




### Birthday Feature

#### Implementation

The birthday feature extends HR Insight by allowing the user to view birthdays in a given month. This is implemented by extracting the `Month` class from the 'Birthday' class.
This operation is exposed in the Command Interface as `Command#BirthdayCommand`. BirthdayCommand can be invoked with or without a parameter.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the birthday mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2: The user executes `add n/John Doe ... ` to add a new employee.

Step 3: After adding a few employees to the application, he/she wants to view the birthdays in the month of January
to prepare the birthday celebrations in advance. The `birthday m/1` command will display all employees with birthdays
in the month of January.

Step 4: The user now wants to view all birthdays that fall in the first quarter, which includes Jan, Feb and Mar. The 
`birthday m/1,2,3` command will display all employees with birthdays in the first quarter. 

Step 4: The user then realizes that today is the first day of a new month and he/she wants to view which employees
have birthdays in the current month. The `birthday` command without providing the month will display all employees with
birthdays in the current month.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `birthday` command works:

![SequenceDiagram](images/BirthdayCommand.png)

#### Design Considerations
The birthday command is designed to show users birthdays by month instead of week or day as month gives the user a broader
range to work with. Furthermore, it is also a common practice for companies to have one celebration for all employees'
birthdays in a month rather than having multiple individual celebrations. Hence, this feature is designed to show
birthdays by month.

**Aspect: How Birthday executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : Allows the user to view birthday in a month
    * Pros: Allows the user to view birthdays in a broader range.
    * Cons: User cannot view birthdays that occur across multiple months
* **Alternative 2**: Allows the user to view birthdays in multiple months
    * Pros: User will be able to view birthdays across multiple months with only one use of the command.<Br>
      (e.g. `birthday m/2,3` returns all birthdays in February and March )
    * Cons: We must ensure that every month given by the user is valid and mention which months have no birthdays.
 

### Change Theme Feature

#### Implementation

This feature adds a way to change the theme of the application.
The default theme is the dark theme, and it can be changed at any point of usage by using the command `theme`.
This is implemented by adding a `Command#ThemeCommand` to take the user input for changing themes. 
The actual changing of the theme itself is done by changing the stylesheet of the `MainWindow`.
`MainWindow` keeps track of the current stylesheet, and when it receives a theme change request, it will remove the current stylesheet and add the new stylesheet using the `setTheme()` function.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the birthday mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2: The user executes `theme` wishing to see the available themes.
This command will return feedback that the theme is invalid, as there are no arguments detected. It will then show the names of the valid themes currently implemented. At the point of time of writing this developer guide, the available themes are `light`, `dark`, `red`, `green`, and `blue`.

Step 3: The user changes the theme by calling `theme red`.
This command will pass through the `ThemeCommandParser` class which will parse the arguments given (`red` in this case). The parse class will then return a `ThemeCommand` containing the name of the stylesheet for the given theme. This will continue to get passed on to `MainWindow` through `CommandResult`. `MainWindow` will then execute the `setTheme()` function, which removes the current stylesheet and adds the new stylesheet to the `MainWindow.fxml` file.

The sequence diagram below shows how the `theme` commands execute:
<img src="images/ThemeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Theme executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users can specify the theme they want to use.
    * Pros: Users can have choices of themes they can use.
    * Cons: More tedious to implement with a need for parsing user commands and translating them to stylesheets.

* **Alternative 2:** Users can only switch between dark and light themes.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, no need for arguments for the command.
    * Cons: Limiting users' choices, the function will be harder to extend in the future.
