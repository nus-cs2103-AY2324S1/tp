<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Introduction**

ProfBook is a tool tailored to helping specifically CS2103T professors and Teaching Assistants(TA) in managing
their tutorial slots and groups. As our target users are technophile, we designed and optimised a CLI-based application
specifically for them. It is currently optimised for CS2103T professors and TA with plans to expand to other Computer
Science Modules. Please refer to our [_User Guide_](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for more
information on ProfBook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Overview**

This guide is intended for future developers, current contributors and users. This guide mainly aims to explain the
implementation of ProfBook to future developers and deepen their knowledge in software development. By the end of this
guide, you can expect to get an overview of the design architecture of ProfBook and comprehensive details of some of its
core features, backed up by UML diagrams.

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `rm 0001Y` to delete student with id `0001Y`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it
  displays [`Displayable`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Displayable.java)
  object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="650"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("rmt 1")` API call
as an example.
`rmt` is the command word for DeleteTaskCommand class. By executing the command `rmt 1`, tha task with index number 1
will be deleted.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTaskSequenceLogicDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rmt 1` Command" width="650"/>

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteTaskSequenceModelDiagram.puml" width="600"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Due to the limitations of PlantUML, the reference frame in the first UML diagram is slightly overlapped.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ProfBookParser` object which in turn creates a
   parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteTaskCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteTaskCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a task).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="650"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ProfBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `Mark`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user
  command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `MarkCommand`) which the `ProfBookParser` returns back as a `Command`
  object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `EditCommandParser`, `HelpCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the ProfBook data i.e., all `Root, Group and Student` objects (which are contained in a
  hierarchical structure in the ProfBook package).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Displayable` objects (e.g., selected task list, children in current folder)
  as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Displayable>` that can
  be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list
  change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<puml src="diagrams/ProfBookClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

The diagram above shows how the folder structure is implemented in ProfBook,

* The hierarchy is as such: `Root` -> `Group` -> `Student`.
* As many of the operations are repeated (e.g. tasks operations and children operations), we decided to abstract out
  these logic into their own classes which is represented by `TaskListManager` and `ChildManager` respectively.
* `ChildManager` manages the children which is of type `IChildElement`.
* We also created a wrapper class (e.g. `ChildrenAndTaskListManager`) for classes that require both of those
  aforementioned functionalities (e.g. `Group` and potentially in the future `TutorialSlot`).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Task sub-package

**API** : [`TaskListManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/TaskListManager.java)

<puml src="diagrams/TaskListClassDiagram.puml" width="250" />

How the `Task` component works:

* As mentioned earlier, `TaskListManager` encapsulates the logic required to maintain a TaskList, this logic is
  utilised heavily in the ProfBook component.
* All tasks extend from the abstract class `Task`, we did this for extensibility. So in the future, should we decide
  to implement a new type of task, all we have to do is extend from `Task`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Model` component, taking an execution of a
`CreateTodoCommand` as example. As the behaviour of `CreateTodoCommand` is rather dynamic, in our example,
we shall be narrowing our scope to adding a todo tasks to a specified group, g.

<puml src="diagrams/AddTaskSequence.puml" width="550" />

How the `Model` component works:

* Depending on the nature of the command, the corresponding method is called to generate a `TaskOperation` or
  a `ChildOperation` object that acts as an interface manipulate the model
* In this case, a `TaskOperation` object is created. This object would store all the necessary information to make
  changes directly on the correct state.
* The `Command` instance calls the required method in the `TaskOperation` object which results in the `TaskOperation`
  object performing the addition of the Todo task to the group.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** For `ChildrenOperation`, `ModelManager` provides more specific factory methods (e.g., `groupChildOperation`,
`rootChildOperation`) to generate the `ChildOperation` object. It is implemented this way so that `ModelManager` is able
to check that the operation required matches with the intended effect of the `Command` object's execution.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Path sub-package

**API** : [`Path.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/path/Path.java)

The `path` package in `model` package serves as a fundamental representation of the hierarchical structure within the
application. It delineates the navigational paths essential for traversal and dynamic command execution within the
system.

Here is a class diagram for the path package:

<puml src="diagrams/PathClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

* The `PathElement` class forms the building blocks for constructing paths within ProfBook.
* `PathElementType` enum defines the type of elements within a  path:
    * `ROOT`: Represents the root element in the hierarchy.
    * `GROUPID`: Represents the element corresponding to a group in the hierarchy.
    * `STUDENTID`: Represents the element corresponding to a student in the hierarchy.
    * `PARENT`: Corresponds to the `..` notation, indicating the parent directory.
    * `CURRENT`: Corresponds to the `.` notation, indicating the current directory.
* `AbsolutePath` represents an absolute path within the system and strictly commences with the `~` element.
    * The `resolve` method is crucial to resolve a `RelativePath` and return the resolved path in `AbsolutePath` type.
    * e.g. Consider an `AbsolutePath` represents `~/grp-001/0001A`. If the `resolve` method is called with the
      `RelativePath` representing `../../grp-002`, the resolve method will return the `AbsolutePath` representing the path
      `~/grp-002`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both ProfBook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ProfBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `ProfBookStorageManager` component's job is to
  save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Folder structure

#### Implementation

Due to the nature of the application that we aim to make, designing a robust folder structure to represent the hierarchy
is crucial to our success. We strive to design a structure that is generic enough to be extended while also being able
to capture unique functionality of the different parties at play.

In our current hierarchy, `Root` -> `Group` -> `Student`, `Student` and `Group` are required to manage tasks
whereas `Root` and `Group` are required to manage children. The `Model` component briefly mentioned this implementation,
but I will delve into it more comprehensively in this implementation.

We first created interfaces to represent the required logic for each of the manager, namely `IChildManager`
and `ITaskListManager`. Then we created concrete classes such as `ChildManager` and `TaskListManager` to encapsulate
the aforementioned logic. The purpose of these classes was so that should a folder type, e.g. `Student`, require a
manager functionality, we could just extend from said manager thus reducing on repeated code. Due to the limitation of
Java, classes are not able to extend from multiple classes. To remedy this, we created a wrapper
class, `ChildrenAndTaskListManager`.

It is important to note that `ChildManager` is a generic class that accepts classes that implements
the `IChildElement` interface. This was done to reduce repeated code while introducing a degree of polymorphism.

In our implementation, only the parents have reference to the child. This reference is stored by using
a `Map<Id, Student>` and `Map<Id, Group>` instance.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

To further illustrate our folder structure, we have prepared this diagram

<puml src="diagrams/AddInitialState.puml" width="550" />

**Aspect: How do we represent the hierarchy**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Tree representation.
    * Pros: Models the hierarchy closely.
    * Cons: It results in a more rigid hierarchy, harder to extend upon.
* **Alternative 2**: Flat structure.
    * Pros: Easier to implement relatively to the tree representation.
    * Cons: 
      * Harder to maintain the hierarchy, search for items and load items from storage.
      * States are more coupled.

**Aspect: How store reference to children**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** HashMap.
    * Pros: Able to check/find if a student/group is present efficiently, mapping objects by their ID also makes
      executing commands in a folder-like structure easier.
    * Cons: Items stored in HashMaps are unordered, meaning addition order is lost.
* **Alternative 2**: List.
    * Pros: Very easy to implement.
    * Cons: Finding a student/group is very inefficient, updating references is also a hassle.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a student/group

#### Implementation

Implementation for creating a `Student` and a `Group` is very similar, so in this guide, I would go through the
implementation for the harder one, which is creating a student. Should you have any questions do feel free to contact
us.

Most of the logic for creating a student is encapsulated in the `CreateStudentCommand` class, this class utilise
the `ChildOperation<Student>` class to add the student to the group and the `Model` class to check for duplicates.
The following methods of `ModelManager` and `ChildOperation<Student>` are used:

1. `ModelManager::groupChildOperation` - To generate an operation class specific to the current group, it also checks for
   the validity and presence of the specified group.
2. `ModelManager::hasStudentWithId` - To check if the new student id is unique.
3. `ChildOperation<Student>::addChild` - To add the current student into the group.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how an existing user can create a student.

1. When the user launches the application, existing information is read from the data file `profbook.json`. The initial
   state would look something like this.

   <puml src="diagrams/AddInitialState.puml" width="600" />

2. Suppose the user is still in the root directory and wants to add a new student to group 1, the user would execute the
   following
   command: `touch ~/grp-001/2000Y --name Bob --email bobby@example.com --phone 92929292 --address blk 258 Toa Payoh`.
   Do note that the only required fields are `--name`.
3. The parser would retrieve all the relevant information from the input and encapsulates it in a `CreateStudentCommand`.
4. This command would first do these checks:
   * checks if the specified path contains the group. This is done via the `ModelManager::hasGroup` method.
   * checks if the specified path is a valid student path. This is done via the `AbsolutePath::isStudentDirectory` method.
   * checks if adding the student would result in a duplicate within whole of ProfBook, ie if the student id is
   already taken. This is done via the `ModelManager::hasStudentWithId` method.
5. In this case, if the input was `touch ~/grp-001/1234Y ...` or `touch ~/grp-001/9876A ...` a `CommandException` will
   be thrown.
6. If all checks out, the command would create a new student and add the student to the `Model`. This addition is done
   through getting a `ChildOperation<Student>` class from the `Model::groupChildOperation` method. This would ensure
   the path to the group is present and valid. The student is added through the `ChildOperation<Student>::addChild` method.
7. It should look something like this.

   <puml src="diagrams/AddFinalState.puml" width="650" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

This sequence diagram shows the general flow of the `CreateStudentCommand`, for more information on each specific
component, do head over to their respective documentation.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateStudentCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />


Below is an activity diagram showing the general activity of the add student command.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateStudentActivityDiagram.puml" width="700" />

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Types of fields**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Fields can be required or optional.
    * Pros: Allows the user to create groups and students without complete information.
    * Cons: Harder to implement features that depends on those optional field.
* **Alternative 2**: Fields must be required.
    * Pros: Easier implementation, there is less need for checking optional field.
    * Cons: All information about a student/group must be readily present before creating it, which is not always the
      case.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Creating a task

#### Implementation

Creating and adding a task is one of the key feature of ProfBook. Currently, we support two types of tasks,
namely `ToDo` and `Deadline` tasks. Both these tasks extends from the abstract `Task` class which add to its
extensibility. It is important to note that currently, you can only add tasks to Groups and Students. Needless to say,
the information for these tasks are encapsulated within their respective `Task`
instance.

As the implementation for creating a `ToDo` and `Deadline` task is very similar, I would be bringing you through
the implementation that we found to be more confusing. I would be going through creating a Deadline task and adding it
to **all students in a group**. For more information you could reach out to us, we would be more than happy
to help.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Illustration in the form of a sequence diagram for creating a `ToDo` and adding a singular
tasks can be found at the `Model` component. 

</box>


Most of the logic for creating a task is encapsulated in the `CreateDeadlineCommand` class, this class utilises
the `ChildOperation<Student>` class to add the Deadline to the group and check for duplicates.
The following methods of `ModelManager` and `ChildOperation<Student>` are used:

1. `ModelManager::groupChildOperation` - To generate an operation class specific to the current group, it also checks for
   the validity and presence of the specified group.
2. `ChildOperation<Student>::addAllTasks` - To add the tasks to all student within a group, it also checks if it is a
   duplicate task before adding.
3. `ChildOperation<Student>::doAllStudentHaveTask` - To check if all children within a group already has the task.

It is important to note that for adding a task to a singular group/student, the operation class `TaskOperation` is used
instead, a sequence diagram illustrating this can be found in the `Model` component.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how an existing user can add Deadline to all students

1. When the user launches the application, existing information is read from the data file `profbook.json`. In our case,
   let us narrow our focus to a specific group with 2 students.

   <puml src="diagrams/DeadlineInitialState.puml" width="500" />

2. Suppose the user is still in the root directory and wants to add a deadline to all students in group1, the user would
   execute the following
   command: `deadline ~/grp-001 --desc Assignment 1 --datetime 2023-12-12 23:59 --all allStu`. More information on the 
   flags could be found in the User Guide.
3. The parser would retrieve all the relevant information from the input and encapsulate it in
   a `CreateDeadlineCommand`.
4. This command would first
    * check if the specified path is a valid and present group path. This is done via `AbsolutePath::isGroupDirectory` method.
    * check if all students in the group already has the task. This is done
      via `ChildOperation<Student>::doAllStudentHaveTask` method.
5. If all checks out, the command would create a new `Deadline` instance and add the deadline to all student that do not
   already have the aforementioned task. This is done
   through getting a `ChildOperation<Student>` class from the `Model::groupChildOperation` method. The tasks are then
   added through the `ChildOperation<Student>::addTaskToAllStudent` method. For each student, the method would check if the
   task is already present, if not it would add the task.
6. It should look something like this.

   <puml src="diagrams/DeadlineFinalState.puml" width="600" />

7. In the above diagram, Jerry already has the exact `Deadline` and adding it would result in a duplicate. Therefore, the
   task is only added to student Ben.

This sequence diagram illustrates the general flow when adding the deadline task to *all* students, the sequence
diagram for adding a deadline task to a *single* student can be found in the `Model` component.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateDeadlineCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

This is an activity diagram showing the general activity of the add deadline command.

<puml src="diagrams/CreateDeadlineActivityDiagram.puml" width="700" />

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: Should groups have their own task list as well**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Yes.
    * Pros: Closely resembles the dynamics in real life.
    * Cons: Harder to implement, more confusing for users.
* **Alternative 2**: No.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Users may not be able to keep track of group related tasks.

**Aspect: how should we implement adding of bulk tasks**

* **Alternative 1:** Add Tasks one by one to each student.
    * Pros: Quick and easy to implement.
    * Cons: Keeping track of group tasks is a hassle, any action done for one task must be done for all.
* **Alternative 2**: Allow groups to have their own task lists.
    * Pros: Quick and easy to implement.
    * Cons: Adding of student tasks must be done manually.
* **Alternative 3 (current implementation)**: Implement both of the aforementioned features.
    * Pros: Best of both worlds.
    * Cons: Harder to implement, user command is also more complex and bulky.

**Aspect: Should the same instance of the task be assigned during bulk task**

* **Alternative 1:** No, each student/group should have their own unique instance.
    * Pros: Each task's completion is independent of others.
    * Cons: Takes more memory.
* **Alternative 2**: Yes.
    * Pros: Able to change all task's state in one short.
    * Cons: Unable to uniquely change a specific tasks without affecting other task, aliasing issue.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing information

#### Implementation

Due to the dynamic need of our target users, professors and TAs, there is a need for our edit command to be equally dynamic.
Our edit command need to be general enough to allow the users to edit both students and groups. This is done by checking
the type of directory that was passed in. This is done through the `AbsolutePath::isGroupDirectory`
and `AbsolutePath::isStudentDirectory` method. 

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** More information on how this is done can be found in the documentation
for `path` package. This then allows parser to check for the validity of the given flags.

</box>

As the implementation for editing students and groups is similar, for simplicity, I would be going through
implementation of editing a group.

The following methods of `ModelManager`, `AbsolutePath` and `ChildOperation<Group>` are used:

1. `ModelManager::rootChildOperation` - To generate an operation class with logic specific to the current root.
2. `ModelManager::hasGroupWithId` - To check if editing results in a duplicate.
3. `ChildOperation<Group>::editChild` - To edit the group with the values extracted from parser.
4. `AbsolutePath::isGroupDirectory` - To check if the path leads to a group directory.
5. `AbsolutePath::isStudentDirectory` - To check if the path leads to a student directory.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario on how an existing user can edit the name of a group.

1. When the user launches the application, existing information is read from the data file `profbook.json`. The initial
   state should look something like this.
   <puml src="diagrams/AddInitialState.puml" width="550" />
2. Suppose the user is still in the root directory and wants to edit the id of group 1 from `grp-001` to `grp-003`, the
   user would execute the following command: `edit ~/grp-001 -i grp-003`.
3. When parsing the command, from the path, the parser would be able to deduce that we are editing a group. It then
   checks the flags to ensure only required flags are present.
4. The fields to be edited is then stored in an `EditGroupDescriptor` instance. (For student it would be stored in
   an `EditStudentDescriptor`)
5. If the id is being edited, `ModelManager::hasGroupWithId` is called to ensure it does not result in a duplicate.
6. The `ChildOperation<Group>::editChild` then makes a copy of the existing group while updating the values found in
   the `EditGroupDescriptor`.

7. It then deletes the old key-value pair in root's `Map<Id, group>` and adds the new key-value pair.

This is illustrated by the following sequence diagram. It shows the general flow of the edit through editing a `Group`
instance, this example should be general enough for you to understand how the edit command works on other classes such
as `Student`.

#### Design Consideration

**Aspect: How to ensure `edit` is able to handle editing students and group**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Implement a generic `edit` which acts differently depending on the input
  path.
    * Pros: Closely follows OOP principals and makes `edit` more extensible
    * Cons: Harder to implement, more confusing for users
* **Alternative 2**: Create multiple `edit` commands.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, it is also more intuitive for users
    * Cons: More commands for user to remember, future additions would prove to be a hassle

### Moving students between groups

#### Implementation

Initially, implementing this feature seemed like a daunting task. However, after finalising our `Model` hierarchy, we
realised that implementing move was quite straight forward. Moving a student can be easily done by removing the
student's reference from its current group by removing its key-value pair from the group's `Map<Id, Student>` field.
Then to complete the move, the student is added to the target group by adding it into the target
group's `Map<Id, Student>` field. All of this operation is facilitated by the `ChildOperation<Student>` class.

Given below is an example usage scenario whereby a student is moved from group1 to group2.

1. When the user launches the application, existing information is read from the data file `profbook.json`.
2. Suppose the user is still in the root directory and wants to move student `1234Y` from `grp-001` to `grp-002`, the
   user would execute the following command: `mv ~/grp-001/1234Y ~/grp-002`.
3. The parser would extract the relevant information and creates a `MoveStudentCommand` instance.
4. The command would check that path to the student and target group is valid and present.
5. Command would then add the student to the target group via the `ChildOperation<Student>::addChild` method. The old
   reference is removed via the `ChildOperation<Student>::deleteChild` method.
6. As uniqueness of student is validated before each student is added, there is no need to check for clashes when
   executing.

## Proposed future features

### Editing tasks

Currently, the only way to edit tasks is by manually deleting and then adding them again. This creates extra hassle for
the user and possible more inconveniences as doing so might change the task's index resulting in the user having
to `cat` again to figure out its new index. We plan to edit the task manually for the user by creating a new command
that deletes and then creates a new task with the edited information while keeping the index the same. Implementing this
is just a combination of deleting and creating, but it improves the user's quality of life greatly.

### Phone number validation

Currently, our application only checks if the phone number is more than 3 characters long. Our current validation is
lacking as users are able to enter a `123` as a phone number or a phone number that is infinitely long. We plan to
improve this validation by enforcing a tighter validation. This can be achieved by creating a `Map<String, Integer>` of
common phone extensions to their length and then enforcing that the phone number be of that length. This allows our
users to have the peace of mind that the phone number is validated and robust enough to handle international numbers.

### Max character length validation

Currently, our application only checks if the required fields (e.g. `--name`, `--desc`) is present. Our current validation is
lacking as users are able to enter a value that is infinitely long which may hinder the performance and functionality of
our GUI. We plan to counteract this by enforcing a max character length for each of our field. Implementing this is
would be rather simple by adding a length check during parsing. We could limit name length to 46 characters, email to 62 
etc. 

### Better marking and un-marking validation

Currently, our application does not check if the tasks are marked or unmarked before any operation. This results in
users being able to mark/un-mark tasks infinitely, this is not intuitive and may mislead some users. Hence, we plan to
only allow users to un-mark tasks that are marked and vice versa. This can be easily done by checking the current state
and throwing an error if the resultant state is same as the current state. Also, we plan to add a more descriptive error
message to highlight to the user of the current state of the task.

### More robust duplicate checking

Currently, our application only checks for duplicates by their id, meaning two students/group are considered the same if
and only if their ids are identical. This means that two students with identical number and email but differing ids are
considered different in ProfBook, needless to say this does not reflect requirements in the real world. Therefore, we
plan to revamp our duplication checking for students by checking for equality between their phone number and email.

### More descriptive error message

Currently, while our application tries to output a descriptive and apt message for each error, we have received feedback
that some of our error message could be more descriptive. One such example is trying to edit the root `~/` directory or
trying to edit a directory that does not exist. In both cases, the error message given
is `Path does not exist in ProfBook`. In this example, we could have mention that you are unable to edit the root
directory for the prior and that the Path does not lead to a student/group for the latter. This is just one example, we
plan to revamp our error message to be more descriptive and user-friendly.

### Include tutorial slot

Currently, our hierarchy only extends to `Group`. To serve our target users better, we plan to add a new level,
`TutorialSlot` to ProfBook. This would allow our target users to juggle not only groups but also tutorial slots.
Implementing this is rather easy as `TutorialSlot` would in theory be almost identical to the implementation of `Group`,
all `TutorialSlot` have to do is just extend from `ChildrenAndTaskListManager`. 


### Implement a grade component to our tasks

Currently, our users can only mark tasks as completed. To serve our target users better, we plan to allow our users to 
assign a grade or score to a task. This would allow our target users to better keep track of and monitor their students
and their groups progress. Implementing this would be adding a new `tag` to our display for tasks and creating a new 
command similar to that of mark that receives and store the grade or score.

### Implement a search function

Currently, our users are unable to filter the current displayed list. We predict that this could be a hassle if the user
is required to manage many groups and students with each having a myriad of tasks. We plan to implement this by creating 
a new command where users would be able to pass in the field that they wish to search by. Then, we can filter the
display list with a simple for-loop.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### **Project Overview**

Our project, ProfBook, underwent a significant transformation with the primary objective of providing robust **student
organization** and **task management** features. The project also aimed to create a **terminal-like application**,
complete with a terminal-like user interface and the ability to navigate through a hierarchical structure.

### **Difficulty Level <span class="badge bg-danger">Challenging</span>**

The project was classified as **challenging** due to:

- **Terminal-Like Functionality:** Creating a terminal-like interface and functionality from scratch was a complex task,
  requiring a deep understanding of terminal behavior and navigation.

- **Hierarchical Structure:** Our application features a hierarchical structure, with ProfBook serving as the root
  entity. Under ProfBook, there are groups, and each group contains students. Managing this hierarchical structure added
  a significant amount of complexity to the project.

- **Diverse Classes:** Unlike AB3, our project needed to handle a more extensive range of classes, including Student,
  Group, and Task. This expansion added complexity as we had to provide functionality for student organization and task
  management within the same application.

### **Effort Required**

The project demanded an estimated total effort of **approximately one month**. The effort was distributed across various
project phases:

- **Design and Architecture:** This phase focused on designing the terminal-like user interface, defining terminal
  behavior, and integrating the hierarchical structure. Additionally, it involved accommodating and ensuring the smooth
  interaction of multiple entity types within the application. We found it especially difficult to find a class generic 
  enough to capture all the different behaviour of each directory in ProfBook while also making it extensible.

- **Implementation and Coding:** The implementation phase was dedicated to building custom components and
  functionalities essential for realizing terminal behavior, hierarchical structure navigation, and handling diverse
  classes.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** This critical phase aimed to ensure the terminal-like interface worked seamlessly,
  the hierarchical structure navigation functionality was error-free, and the application effectively managed the
  different entity types.

- **Documentation:** Preparing comprehensive documentation was essential for guiding both users and developers in
  understanding and utilizing the terminal-like application.

### **Effort Savings through Reuse**

A notable aspect of our project was the efficient use of custom logics, which contributed to a significant reduction
in the overall effort.

- **Path package:** We introduced the `path` package, which includes subclasses for managing both **absolute** and 
**relative** paths. This package played a crucial role in managing navigation and executing dynamic commands within
  our application.

- **ChildManager Component:** The class was instrumental in representing the hierarchical structure in our
  application. We successfully leveraged this class to perform operations related to child entities, optimizing the
  handling of students within groups and groups within the ProfBook.

- **TaskListManager class:** This class streamlines task management and allocation by providing a consistent and
  unified interface for handling tasks throughout the application.

Reusing these logics enhanced project efficiency and maintainability.
