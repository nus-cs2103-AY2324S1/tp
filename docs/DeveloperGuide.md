## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>
<puml src="diagrams/BottomListPanelClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BottomListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `UniMateParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `UniMateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `UniMateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, calendar data, task manager data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`,`CalendarStorage`, `TaskManagerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//@@author lihongguang00
### Adding Events

#### Implementation

The addEvent feature is facilitated by the `Calendar` class. It allows the users to block out some time
in their personal `Calendar` with some `Event` that has the following attributes:

* `DESCRIPTION`  —  Brief description of the `Event`
* `START_DATE_TIME`  —  Starting date and time of the `Event`
* `END_DATE_TIME`  —  End date and time of the `Event`

The syntax used to call this command is as follows: `addEvent d/DESCRIPTION ts/START_DATE_TIME te/END_DATE_TIME`,
with the `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format. If any of the fields are missing
or if the formatting is incorrect, an error message will be thrown along with usage instructions on the correct
formatting.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addEvent feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user's personal `Calendar` will be initialized
as an empty calendar.

Step 2. The user executes `addEvent d/Go to school ts/2023-10-26 08:00 te/2023-10-26 16:00` to add the `Event`
of `Go to school` from `2023-10-26 8am` to `2023-10-26 4pm`. This will call the `UniMateParser#execute()`,
passing in the user input from the user.

Step 3. Since the command is an `addEvent` command, it passes the user input to `AddEventCommandParser#parse()`
for parsing.

Step 4. The `AddEventCommandParser#parse` command will parse the command into 3 argument fields  — 
`DESCRIPTION`, `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME`. The `DESCRIPTION` is passed into
`ParserUtil#parseEventDescription()` to produce a `EventDescription` object, while the `START_DATE_TIME`
and `END_DATE_TIME` are passed into `ParserUtil#parseEventPeriod()` to produce a `EventPeriod` object.

**Note**: If the `DESCRIPTION` is empty, or the `START_DATE_TIME` or `END_DATE_TIME` are of invalid
format, a `ParseException` will be thrown, displaying the appropriate command usage format.

Step 5. The `EventDescription` and `EventPeriod` objects produced in Step 4 are then passed into
the constructor for `Event`, creating an `Event` object with the respective user-defined attributes. This
`Event` object is then passed into the constructor of the `AddEventCommand` object.

Step 6. `AddEventCommand#execute()` is then called, and the calendar will check if there is an existing
`Event` that has a conflicting timing with the new `Event` to be added. Since the calendar is empty,
no errors will be raised and the user will see his new `Event` displayed in the UI in the `My Calendar`
region.

**Note**: Suppose there is a conflicting `Event` that already exists in the `Calendar`
with the `Event` to be added, the new `Event` will not be added, and a message that states that there
is a timing conflict will be reflected in the UI status bar.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Appropriate time period of an event:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice): No restriction on time period**
    * Pros: Allows users to add multi-day `Event` such as multi-day business trips.
    * Cons: For users that rarely have multi-day `Event`, having to type the date twice when calling the command might be troublesome.
* **Alternative 2: Restrict events to a single day**
    * Pros: User only has to type date once when calling command.
    * Cons: For multi-day `Event`, user has to call the command multiple times for all the relevant days


//@@author Fallman2
### Deleting Events

#### Implementation

The deletion of events is facilitated by the `model::deleteEventAt` method and the `model::findEventAt` method. The
former method deletes the event stored in the `Calendar` object which itself is an attribute of the `Model` object by
calling a similar method `Calendar::deleteEventAt`. These methods take in a `LocalDateTime` object and finds the method
within the `Calendar` object, then in the case of `model::deleteEventAt`, deletes the event. Given below is an example
usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application and creates an event.

Step 2. The user executes `deleteEvent 2023-12-09 12:00` command to delete the event at that time. The `deleteEvent`
command calls `Model#findEventAt(LocalDateTime)` to find an event at the specified date and time. This event is then stored as a
variable `toDelete`.

**Note**: If no event is found at the specified date and time at any point of the command execution, an
`EventNotFoundException` is thrown which causes an error message to be displayed.

Step 3. The command then calls `Model#deleteEventAt(LocalDateTime)`. This method calls similar methods of
`Calendar#deleteEventAt(LocalDateTime)` which calls `AllDaysEventListManager#deleteEventAt(LocalDateTime)`.

Step 4. The `AllDaysEventListManager` checks for an event at the specified date and time again, then checks for all days
for which the event lasts for. Then, for each day, the event is removed from the `SingleDayEventList`.

Step 5. The deleted event which was previously stored in as a variable is displayed in the `CommandResult` to show the
user which command was deleted.

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: Appropriate input:**

* **Alternative 1: Use Event start time as input:**
  * Pros: Allows the user to more specifically select which event is deleted.
  * Cons: The exact start time of the event has to be used to delete the event.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice): Use any time within the event as input:**
  * Pros: Allows for more flexibility in the time given for the event to be deleted.
  * Cons: User may be confused on which event is being deleted.

### Clearing all events within a time frame

All events within a time frame can be cleared using the `ClearEvents` command.
The command requires the start and end time of the time frame to be cleared as inputs. 
All events that fall within or intersect with the time frame (start time inclusive, end time exclusive) are selected to be deleted.
This command also has an optional confirmation as input. If the confirmation is not present in the input, the deletion will not be executed and instead, the events
that would have been executed are displayed in the result. The command can then be reentered with the confirmation to confirm the deletion.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application and creates multiple events.

Step 2. The user executes `clearEvents ts/2023-02-03 12:00 te/2023-02-03 14:00` to view all events within the time range.

Step 3. The `ClearEventsCommandParser` creates an `EventPeriod` representing the indicated time frame and creates a new `ClearEventsCommand` with this `EventPeriod`.

**Note**: At this step, if no events are found within the `EventPeriod` given, a `CommandException` is thrown and an error message is displayed.

Step 4. The `ClearEventsCommand` calls the `Model#eventsInRange(EventPeriod)` method to find all events in the specified time range.

Step 5. All events within the time range are returned and displayed in the command result.

Step 6. The user views all events that would be deleted.

Step 7. The user executes `clearEvents ts/2023-02-03 12:00 te/2023-02-03 14:00 c/CONFIRMED` to confirm the deletion.

Step 8. The `ClearEventsCommand` calls the `Model#eventsInRange(EventPeriod)` method to find all events in the specified time range.

Step 9. For each event in range, the command calls the `Model#deleteEventsInRange(EventPeriod)` which deletes all events within the range.

Step 10. All deleted events are displayed in the command result.

<puml src="diagrams/ClearEventsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ClearEventsSequenceDiagram"/>

### Calendar Comparison (compareCalendars)

#### Implementation

When the command `compareCalendars` is called, the arguments passed by the users are converted into a list of `Index` in `CompareCalendarByIndexCommandParser#parse()`.
The list of `Index` is then passed as an argument into the constructor `CompareCalendarByIndexCommand#new()`. Subsequently, when `CompareCalendarByIndexCommand#execute()` is called,
the list of `Person` stored in the AddressBook is retrieved using `ModelManger#getFilteredPersonList()`, and the `Person` associated with each `Index` is extracted
with `List#get()`. Their respective `UniMateCalendar` is then extracted with `Person#getCalendar()`, and all the `UniMateCalendar` of the user and relevant contacts are
merged and reduce into a single `UniMateCalendar` with `UniMateCalendar#combineCalendar()`. This combined `UniMateCalendar` is then used to produce the grey event cards
seen in the pop-up comparison calendar window displayed to the user with `CalendarEventSpace#addSolidEventCards()`.

Step 1. The user launches the application and creates an event in the current week.

Step 2. The user creates an event in the current week for one of their contact. For this example, let's assume the contact is `Alex Yeoh` at `Index` 1 of the AddressBook.

Step 3. The user executed `compareCalendars 1`. The `CompareCalendarByIndexCommandParser#parse()` creates a list of `Index` containing a single `Index` object from
 created from the user's argument `1`, and passed it into `CompareCalendarByIndexCommand#new()`.

Step 4. The `CompareCalendarByIndexCommand#execute()` will turn the `Index` list into a `Stream` with `Arrays#stream()`, and each `Index` in the stream will be 
converted into the `Person` with the given `Index` with `Stream#map()` and `List#get()` as the `map()` function input. 

Step 5. The stream is further converted into a `Stream` of `UniMateCalendar` with `Stream#map()` and `Person#getCalendar()` as the `map()` function input. 

Step 6. Eventually, we call `Stream#reduce()` with the user's `UniMateCalendar` as seed, merging all of the `UniMateCalendar` in the `Stream` into a single one with `UniMateCalendar#combineCalendar()`.

Step 7. The resultant `UniMateCalendar` then has the `Event` stored in it converted into grey event cards with `CalendarEventSpace#addSolidEventCards()`, which
reflects in the resultant pop-up comparison calendar window.

<puml src="diagrams/CompareCalendarsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CompareCalendarsSequenceDiagram"/>

**Design Consideration**

**Aspect: Whether to show calendar on a new pop-up or in the main GUI:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice): Pop-up window**
    * Pros: Looks cleaner since the comparison calendar is in an isolated window.
    * Cons: User needs to close the pop-up, which might be inconvenient.
* **Alternative 2: Display the calendar on the main application GUI**
    * Pros: Less application tabs for the user to manage.
    * Cons: More clutter on the main GUI.


### Contact Filtering

#### Implementation

The filtering function executed by `FilterCommand` is facilitated by the `PersonFilter` class.
which itself is similar to the `EditPersonDescriptor` class found in `EditCommand.java`. It stores the fields by which
the contacts are to be filtered and creates a predicate to facilitate the filtering. Notably, it implements the
following operation:

* `PersonFilter#matchesFilter(Person)` - Compares the values of the attributes of the `Person` to the strings stored as
  attributes in the `PersonFilter` object. This method is later used as a lambda method to filter the contact list.

Given below is an example of how the filter function works at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `filter n/Bob t/CS` to filter contacts to see only people with "Bob" in their name and have at
least 1 tag with "CS" in it. The input is passed to `UniMateParser` which then parses it with the `FilterCommandParser`.

Step 2. The `FilterCommandParser` parses the input and creates a corresponding `PersonFilter` object with null for all
parameters. It then sets all specified attributes of the created `PersonFilter` while leaving unspecified fields as
null. The `FilterCommandParser` finally returns a newly created `FilterCommand` with the PersonFilter used in the
constructor.

Step 3. `FilterCommand#execute` is called. In this method, `model#updateFilteredPersonList` is called with
`PersonFilter#matchesFilter` being used as the predicate. This updates the GUI and populates the filtered list with
only `Person` objects that match the filter.

Step 4. The number of people displayed is returned as a `CommandResult`.

### Contact Sorting

#### Implementation
The sort function executed by `SortCommand`.

The sort function allows users to sort all persons in UniMate based on a given criteria, and has the following attributes:

* `COMPARATOR`  —  AddressBook sorting criteria
* `reverse`  —  Determines if sorting is by descending order

The syntax used to call this command is as follows: `sort /COMPARATOR [/reverse]`,
with the `COMPARATOR` being one of `/byname`, `/byemail`, `/byphone`, `/byaddress` to sort by name, email, phone and address respectively. If any of the fields are missing or if the formatting is incorrect, an error message will be thrown along with usage instructions on the correct formatting. The `/reverse` parameter is optional to sort in descending order instead.

Given below is an example of how the sort function works at each step. We will simulate a user using the sort function to sort UniMate contacts by name in descending order.

Step 1. The user executes `sort /byname /reverse` to find his friend's contact. The input is passed into `UniMateParser` which then parses it with the `SortCommandParser`.

Step 2. The `SortCommandParser` parses the input and first checks for arguments provided. If the arguments are empty, invalid or in the wrong format, a helper message will appear to allow the user to reference the sample run case. The arguments are then matched by the keywords provided to determine the basis for sorting using a `SortComparator`. All the comparators are added into an ArrayList of `SortComparator` for `SortCommand` to parse.

Step 3. `SortCommand` is initialized parses the array from step 2 to determine the basis of comparison when the command is executed. The `SortCommandParser` finally returns a newly created `SortCommand` consisting of a Person Comparator that decides the method of sorting for the UniMate address book.

Step 4. `SortCommand#execute` is called. In this method, `model#sortPersonList` is called with the Person Comparator created in step 3. This in turn calls `AddressBook#sortPersons` which calls the storage function to save the contacts in the json file based on the sorted order.

Step 5. The GUI then reads in the json file to obtain the order of addresses and populates the sorted list with the sorting criteria provided.

Step 6. The success message is returned as a `CommandResult` and displayed on the GUI result display panel.

Here's a sequence diagram to summarise the steps above:

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram"/>

**Design considerations**

* The design of the `sort` command is dependent on the structure of the `AddressBookStorage` object. Should the structure
  of how the AddressBook objects are stored change, a new implementation will be required for the command.

//@@author

### TaskList Feature

The task list feature is facilitated by 'TaskManager'. It extends a ReadOnlyTaskManager that will be used for 
saving users' tasks. The data of the TaskManager is contained in a `TaskList` object. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `TaskManager#addTask(Task)` -- Adds a task to the current task list and saves it to memory.
* `TaskManager#deleteTask(int)` -- Delete an existing task from the current task list as indicated by its index and saves the change to memory.
* `TaskManager#sortTasksBy(String)` -- Sets the comparator by which the internal TaskList is sorted to one of two preset options. 
This method only accepts the strings `"Description"` or `"Deadline"` as input and throws an error otherwise.
* `TaskManager#getTaskList()` -- Returns and exposes the internal `TaskList` as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed'.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask(Task)`, `Model#deleteTask(int)`, `Model#sortTasksBy` and `Model#getTaskList` respectively.

A `Task` object consists of a `TaskDescription` and can have up to 1 `Deadline`.

#### Adding Tasks

The adding of tasks is facilitated by the `TaskManager#addTask(Task)` method.
The method adds a `Task` to the `TaskList` object which itself is an attribute of the `TaskManager` object by
calling a similar method `TaskList#addTask(Task)`.

#### Implementation

These methods take in a `Task` object and adds the `Task` object to the `TaskList`.
Given below is an example usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `addTask d/CS2105 Assignment te/2023-12-12 12:00 ` command to add the task.

**Note**: While `Tasks` can have the same `TaskDescription` or `Deadline`, they cannot have both the same `TaskDescription` and `Deadline`.

Step 3. The `addTask` method in the model is called, which calls the `addTask` method in the TaskManager, adding the task to the `TaskList`.

Step 4. The `TaskList` is saved to the memory.

**Design considerations**

* The design of the `addTask` command is such that a deadline is made optional since some tasks are recurring or do not have a specific deadline.

### Viewing Tasks

Tasks can only be viewed in the bottom panel of the GUI which, by default, shows the events list instead.
The viewing of tasks is facilitated by the `SwitchListCommand` which interacts with the UI to swap the bottom list between the event list and the task list.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of the command.

Step 1: The user launches the application.

Step 2: The user executes `switchList` command to view the task list.

**Note**: If the task list is already displayed, the command switches the list back to the event list instead.

Step 3: The `MainWindow` class of the UI switches the bottom list to the task list. The task list will now display the task list, allowing the user to view all tasks.

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: Mode of display:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Display the task list in the same area as another UI component:**
  * Pros: The UI will be less cluttered and can have smaller minimum space.
  * Cons: Both the event list and the task list cannot be viewed at the same time.
* **Alternative 2: Display the task list in a separate area of the UI:**
  * Pros: Both the event list and the task list can be viewed at the same time.
  * Cons: The UI may be more cluttered.

#### Deleting Tasks

The deletion of tasks is facilitated by the `TaskManager#deleteTask(int)` method.
The method deletes a `Task` from the `TaskList` object which is an attribute of the `TaskManager` object by calling a similar method `TaskList#deleteTask(int)`.
This in turn deletes the task in `TaskList` that is indicated by its index within the `TaskList`.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `switchList` command to view the task list on the GUI.

Step 3. The user executes `deleteTask 1` command to delete the first task shown in the task list as displayed in the GUI.

Step 4. The `deleteTask` method in the model is called, which calls the `deleteTask` method in the TaskManager, deleting the task from the `TaskList`.

Step 5. The `TaskList` is saved to the memory.

**Design considerations**

**Aspect: Appropriate Input:**

* **Alternative 1: Use Task description and deadline as input:**
  * Pros: User does not need to refer to the GUI to confirm which task is being deleted.
  * Cons: The exact description and deadlines have to be provided since tasks can have the same description or deadline.
* **Alternative 2 (Current Choice): Use displayed index as input:**
  * Pros: Much less input is required from the user.
  * Cons: The user has to view the task list displayed in the GUI to confirm which task is being deleted.

### Sorting Tasks

#### Implementation

Tasks in the TaskList can be sorted either alphabetically by description or by deadlines. The accepted inputs for these are `sortTasks Description` and `sortTasks Deadline` respectively.
The sorting of tasks is facilitated by the `sortTasks` command.
Given below is an example usage scenario of the command.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user switches to the task list with the `switchList` command.

Step 3. The user executes the `sortTasks Description` command to sort tasks by description alphabetically.

Step 4. A `SortTasksCommand` is created after the command is parsed by the `SortTasksCommandParser`.

Step 5. Upon execution, the `SortTasksCommand` calls `Model#sortTasks(String)` and passes the sorting method of `Description` represented by a String to it.

Step 6. The `TaskManager#sortTasks(String)` method is called and the `sortingOrder` attribute of type `Comparator<Task>` of the `TaskManager` is set to the appropriate type.

Step 7. The internal `TaskList` is sorted by the `sortingOrder`.

//@@author nicrandomlee
### Edit Contact Event

#### Implementation
The Edit Contact Event function executed by `editContactEvent` allows users to edit all person's calendar events in UniMate, and has the following attributes:

* `PERSON_INDEX`  —  Index of the target person
* `EVENT_INDEX`  —  Index of the target person's calendar event
* `DESCRIPTION`  —  Brief description of the edited `Event`
* `NEW_START_DATE_TIME`  —  Starting date and time of the edited `Event`
* `NEW_END_DATE_TIME`  —  End date and time of the edited `Event`

The syntax used to call this command is as follows: `editContactEvent PERSON_INDEX EVENT_INDEX [d/DESCRIPTION] [ts/NEW_START_DATE_TIME][te/NEW_END_DATE_TIME]`, with the `START_DATE_TIME` and `END_DATE_TIME` in the `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` format. If any of the fields are missing or if the formatting is incorrect, an error message will be thrown along with usage instructions on the correct formatting.

Given below is an example of how the editContactEvent function works at each step. We will simulate a user using the editContactEvent function to sort UniMate contacts by name in descending order. 

Step 1. The user executes `editContactEvent 1 1 d/CS2103 meeting ts/2023-11-11 10:00 te/2023-11-11 12:00` to reschedule the meeting with his CS2103 module group mate. The input is passed into `UniMateParser` which then parses it with the `EditContactEventCommandParser`.

Step 2. The `EditContactEventCommandParser` parses the input and first checks for arguments provided. If the arguments are empty, invalid or in the wrong format, a helper message will appear to allow the user to reference the sample run case. The arguments are then matched by delimiters `d/`, `ts/` amd `te/` to determine the fields to be edited. If certain fields are empty (for example, the user just wants to change the time start and time end of the meeting), the event description from the edited event will be retained when `EditContactEventCommand#execute` is executed in step 4.

Step 3. `EditContactEventCommandParser` creates a temporary event `EditEventDescriptor` as well as an array consisting of two elements, that is the PERSON_INDEX and EVENT_INDEX to be parsed. The `EditContactEventCommandParser` finally returns a newly created `EditContactEventCommand` consisting of the array and the temporary event.

Step 4. `EditContactEventCommand#execute` is called. In this method, a new person object is created with the same attributes except an updated calendar with the updated event instead. `model#setPerson` is called to replace the target person with the new person. The observable list is then refreshed to show the new calendar event.

Step 5. The success message is returned as a `CommandResult` and displayed on the GUI result display panel.

Here's a sequence diagram to summarise the steps above:

**Design considerations**

* The design of the `EditContactEvent` command is dependent on the structure of the `CalendarStorage` object. Should the structure of how the Calendar objects are stored change, a new implementation will be required for the command.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**
### Main Difficulty: Building User Calendar
This part was especially difficult because we wanted to conform to the structure of the base `AB3` code, knowing it is a brownfield project. 
Thus, we wanted to ensure the abstraction granularity of the classes matched that of `AB3` (e.g. Separate classes for every single attribute of `Person`), 
which explains why the `UniMateCalendar` class is so granular, as seen in the [model class diagram](#model-component).

Furthermore, we knew from the beginning that we wanted to allow users to compare their `Calendar` with that of their contacts.
Therefore, from the start, we had to write code that would make this feature possible.

The UI for the calendar was also challenging because nobody in the group had experience in desktop application UI development and JavaFx.
Understanding JavaFx, before even implementing it in the creation of new GUI elements, required a few hours and much trial and error.
It was also challenging to implement GUI components while ensuring that all elements that were already previously implemented worked as well.

Lastly, the feature where the calendar would "grow" and "shrink" according to the events that the user have in real time
took a lot of careful problem-solving to avoid breaking abstraction barrier and introducing cyclic dependencies, since
we had to establish a line of communication between the `UniMateCalendar` of the `Model` interface and the `UI` interface,
and the `Observable` and `Observer` interfaces were only introduced later into the module, by which we had already implemented
this feature.

### Other Difficulty: Contact Calendar
Integrating the calendar into the contacts in the AddressBook was challenging, but was slightly easier as we could just reuse the
code that we have written for the `UniMateCalendar`. However, we still had to learn how to make the calendar of the contacts show up
in a new window rather than in the main application GUI.

### Other Difficulty: Task Manager/Event List
For the Task Manager, the main difficulty lies in following the structure of the `AB3` code.
While the implementation of the TaskManager was not complicated, we wanted to properly abstract the different classes from each other similarly to the
structure of AB3. Thus, the implementation required a large number of lines of code and methods, all of which required even more JUnit tests, multiplying
the number of hours spent on implementing the TaskManager. However, the implementation of the GUI for the TaskManager did not take as long as that
of the Calendar as the TaskManager used the same area of the GUI as the event list. That being said, given that no one in our team had experience working
on a GUI, especially with JavaFx, a few hours had to be spent in researching what would be the best way to carry out the switching of the lists from one to the other.

Additionally, for both `Task List` and `Event List`, making the list update in real time when new `Task`/`Event` are added was also difficult. When implementing
the GUI, we had wanted to ensure that commands executed in the main window would reflect appropriately in both the user's own task and event lists but also
for the pop-up event list of individual persons in the AddressBook. This proved to be another challenge as we would encounter several bugs while implementing
this feature. However, we managed to work together as a group to fix most of them.

### Achievements:
- Calendar UI that will update in real time when user adds/deletes event
- Working calendar comparison feature
- We were able to integrate 2 separate and very different components, `Task manager` and `Calendar`, successfully into the base `AB3` code
- Live updates for the `Task List` and `Event List`

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Better Confirmation for ClearEventsCommand
Currently, for the ClearEventsCommand, the user has to re-enter the command entirely with the confirmation text in order
to confirm the deletion of the events. This implementation has an advantage of being able to bypass the confirmation 
check if the user wishes to delete the events more quickly but is otherwise clumsier to use. One way we tried to 
circumvent this is by displaying the message with the confirmation in the result shown but this would not be as convenient
for users who do not wish to use their mouse. A better implementation would be to have the confirmation only require the
user to key in Y or N to confirm or deny the deletion, allowing the events to still be deleted quickly for users who wish
to do so but also allowing for less text to be keyed in to confirm.

### More Ways to Sort Tasks
Currently, there are only two ways to sort tasks. This can cause some tasks to be buried under others if they are not 
prioritized in either sorting method. Being able to sort tasks by proximity to the current date or being able to reverse
the order of sorting of the tasks may help in making all tasks visible to the user so as to ensure that all tasks are 
completed on time.

### Allow user to view beyond the current week restriction for the calendar
Currently, the calendar for the user and contacts is restricted to viewing the current week's events. Therefore, the
user has no means of navigating looking at their events for other weeks other than the current one. This might impede
the user experience as the user might want to check their timetable for some timeframe in the near future (e.g. proceeding week).
Therefore, allowing the user to view their events for any week beyond just the current one might improve user experience,
reducing the dependency the user has on the `Event List` to view events beyond this chronological restriction.

### Allow users to compare calendars with contacts beyond the current week
Currently, the user can only compare calendars with their contacts for the current week. Therefore, if the user wants to
schedule a meeting in a week beyond the current one, they might have difficulty as they might not be able to compare
their calendars with their contacts for that specific week. Therefore, allowing the user to navigate beyond the current
week restriction for the compare calendar feature will be hugely beneficial to the user.

### Allow users to add single day events without typing the date twice
Currently, when the user wants to add an `Event` into their `Calendar`, they have to type the date of the event twice
(once in start date and time and another in end date and time). For single day events, this can be inconvenient. Hence,
we hope to introduce a command that will allow users to add a single day event without typing the date twice.

### Allow users to add recurring events
Currently, our `Calendar` only supports adding of singular events. We hope to allow users to add recurring events in the future
to more accurately simulate the events that the user might have in a University context, where they might have recurring classes
every week.

### Allow users to import .ics format files
Currently, UniMate has no support for importing of external files. Allowing users to import .ics files, which is a common export
format of other calendar platforms, will allow UniMate to integrate more seamlessly with other calendar applications.
