### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)
<!-- TODO: Add Plan-related UI stuff into the diagram -->
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the FriendBook data i.e., all `Person` and `Plan` objects (which are contained in `UniquePersonList` and `UniquePlanList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `Plan` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Plan>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both FriendBook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### _New features added to FriendBook_

### 1. `add-plan`

![FindPlanCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddPlanCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The add-plan command allows users to add a new Plan, provided that it involves a friend who is present in `UniquePersonList` and the Plan does not already exist.

Add-plan is done similarly to the original add command in AddressBook.
![FindPlanCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddPlanCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
The `add-plan` command is executed by the `Logic`, then parsed by the AddressBookParser. It then creates a `AddPlanCommandParser`. This is then used to parse the command. This results in a `AddPlanCommand` object. The `.execute()` method of the `AddPlanCommand` object is then invoked by `Logic`. Following this, `AddPlanCommand` then communicates with `Model`. It first uses the `Model::getPersonByName` function to check if that friend exists. If the friend exists, a `Plan` object is created, and `Model` helps to add it. Finally, a `CommandResult` is returned.

Note that there are several classes not included in the above diagram, but still used. These include (but are not limited to) the `AddressBook` class which stores `UniquePersonList` and `UniquePlanList`. A `Plan` object also requires `PlanName`, `PlanDateTime` and a `Person` object as the friend associated with the Plan.

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### 2. `find-plan`

The `find-plan` command allows the user to find all plans associated with a saved friend. The plans list on the
Ui will be updated to display the relevant plans. This mechanism is facilitated by the `Model` interface through
has the following operations:
* `Model#getPersonByName(Name)` - Gets the friend (Person object) by Name input.
* `Model#updateFilteredPlanList(Predicate)` - Filters the list of plans to display by the Predicate input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find plan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user has friends and some plans associated to the friends. The `Model` will store the list of plans in the
form of a `FilteredList` type.

Step 2. The user executes `find-plan Alex` command to find all plans associated with `Alex` saved in the FriendBook.
As described in the Logic Component above, this will create a `FindPlanCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` will call `FindPlanCommand#execute()` to start the search for plans. Then, `Model#getPersonByName(Name)`
will be called to find the friend with the given Name, returning a `Person` instance.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If no friends can be found in the address book with the given Name, an error will be thrown and the mechanism will terminate.
</div>

Step 4. `FindPlanCommand#execute()` then creates a `PlanContainsFriendPredicate` instance that checks if a `Plan` composes of the `Person` instance returned in step 3.

Step 5. Finally, this `Predicate` instance will be inputted into the `Model#updateFilteredPlanList(Predicate)` method to filter for the `Plan` objects that satisfy the
`Predicate` from step 4. This will allow the Ui to display the filtered plans, representing the plans associated with the given name (unique to a Person object).

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find-plan` command works.

![FindPlanCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindPlanCommandSequenceDiagram.png)





The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `find-plan` command:

![FindPlanCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindPlanCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: What `find-plan` command takes in:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Friend's Full Name
    * Pros: Guaranteed to find a unique friend (if saved in FriendBook).
    * Cons: User may find difficulty remembering the full name, or face typo issues.

* **Alternative 2:** Friend's First Name
  itself.
    * Pros: Will be more convenient for the user to query.
    * Cons: Implementation of finding by First Name is more challenging, and there may be duplicate friends with the same First Name,
  since each Person object's First Name does not have to be unique.

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### 3. `delete-plan`

The `delete-plan` command allows the user to delete a plan. The plans list on the
Ui will be updated to display the relevant plans. This mechanism is facilitated by the `Model` interface through
has the following operations:
* `Model#deletePlan(Plan)` - Gets the plan (Plan object) by Plan input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find plan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user has plans. The `Model` will store the list of plans in the
form of a `FilteredList` type.

Step 2. The user executes `delete-plan index` command to find plan at that index in the FriendBook.
As described in the Logic Component above, this will create a `DeletePlanCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` will call `DeletePlanCommand#execute()` to start the search for plans. Then, `Model#deletePlan(Plan)`
will be called to delete that plan.

Step 4. `Model#deletePlan(Plan)` will call `AddressBook#removePlan(Plan)` which will then remove the plan from the UniquePlanList in the FriendBook.

Step 5. The Ui will display a success message if the command is successful and the error message otherwise.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If no plan can be found in the address book with the given index, an error will be thrown and the mechanism will terminate.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `delete-plan` command:
![DeleteActivityDiagram](diagrams/DeletePlanCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### 4. `edit-plan`

The `edit-plan` command is done similarly to the original `edit` command in AddressBook. It allows users to edit the details of their plans which will be updated accordingly in the Ui. The `edit-plan` command is executed by the `Logic`, then parsed by the AddressBookParser. It then creates a `EditPlanCommandParser`. This is then used to parse the command. This results in a `EditPlanCommand` object. The `.execute()` method of the `EditPlanCommand` object is then invoked by `Logic`. The command then communicates with `Model` when it is executed. This mechanism is facilitated by the `Model` interface through the following operations:

* `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` - Gets the list of Plans.
* `Model#setPlan(Plan, Plan)` - Updates the list of Plans with a new Plan with new details.
* `Model#updateFilteredPlanList(Predicate)` - Filters the list of plans to display by the Predicate input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit plan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user has plans. The `Model` will store the list of plans in the form of a `FilteredList` type.

Step 2. The user edits a plan and executes `edit-plan 1 n/Meeting` command to edit the plan indexed 1. As described in the Logic Component above, this will create a `EditPlanCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` will call `EditPlanCommand#execute()` to start the operation of the command. It will first call, `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` to get the list of Plans, returning the `FilteredList` instance that contains the user's list of plans.

Step 4. With the index entered by the user, the plan at that index is retrieved from the user's List of Plans.

Step 5. Next, the `Model#getPersonByName(Name)` will be called to find the friend with the given Name, returning a `Person` instance. This step only executes if the `Person` instance associated with the `Plan` is being edited.

Step 6. `EditPlanCommand#createEditedPlan(Plan, EditPlanDescriptor)` is called in order to create a new `Plan` instance with updated fields.

Step 7. `Model#setPlan(Plan)` then marks the replaces existing `Plan` instance with the new `Plan` instance created in Step 6.

Step 8. Finally, the updates made in the Plan will be synced to the user's List of Plans by `Model#updateFilteredPlanList(Predicate)` method.

Step 9. The Ui will display the change of status of the Plan in the Plan List. On top of that, the Ui will display a success message if the command is successful and the error message otherwise.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit-plan` command works.

![EditPlanCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditPlanCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `command-plan` command:

![EditPlanCommandActivityDiagram](images/EditPlanCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div class="pdfbreak"></div>

### 5. `complete-plan`

The `complete-plan` command allows the users to mark their plans as completed.
The Plan status will then be updated accordingly in the Ui. This mechanism is facilitated by the `Model` interface through
has the following operations:
* `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` - Gets the list of Plans.
* `Model#completePlan(Plan)` - Marks the Plan as completed.
* `Model#updateFilteredPlanList(Predicate)` - Filters the list of plans to display by the Predicate input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the complete plan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user has plans. The `Model` will store the list of plans in the form of a `FilteredList` type.

Step 2. The user completed a plan and executes `complete-plan 1` command to mark the plan indexed 1 as completed.
As described in the Logic Component above, this will create a `CompletePlanCommand` instance.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` will call `CompletePlanCommand#execute()` to start the operation of the command.
It will first call, `Model#getFilteredPlanList()` to get the list of Plans, returning the `FilteredList` instance
that contains the user's list of plans.

Step 4. With the index entered by the user, the plan at that index is retrieved from the user's List of Plans.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the index entered by the user is
invalid or greater than the length of list of plans, an error will be thrown and the mechanism will terminate.
</div>

Step 5. `Model#completePlan(Plan)` then marks the chosen `Plan` instance from step 4 as completed.

Step 6. Finally, the updates made in the Plan will be synced to the user's List of Plans by
`Model#updateFilteredPlanList(Predicate)` method.

Step 7. The Ui will display the change of status of the Plan in the Plan List. On top of that, the Ui will display
a success message if the command is successful and the error message otherwise.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `complete-plan` command works.

![CompletePlanCommandSequenceDiagram](images/CompletePlanCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `command-plan` command:
