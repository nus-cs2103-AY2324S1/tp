## Design Overview

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" alt="Architecture Diagram"/>

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above provides a high-level design overview of the application.

Below is a quick overview of the main components and their interactions:

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Main Components:

- **`Main`**: Responsible for initializing other components in the correct sequence upon application launch, and ensures proper shut down procedures are followed. It consists of [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) classes.

- **`UI`** ([Details](#ui-component)): Manages the User Interface of the app.
- **`Logic`** ([Details](#logic-component)): Handles command execution.
- **`Model`** ([Details](#model-component)): Manages in-memory data.
- **`Storage`** ([Details](#storage-component)): Handles reading from and writing to the hard disk.

- **`Commons`**: A collection of classes used by multiple components.

#### Component Interactions:

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between components for the `delete 1` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram" />

Each of the four main components:

- Defines its API in an interface named after the component.
- Implements its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class, following the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component's API is defined in `Logic.java`, and its functionality is implemented in `LogicManager.java`.

---

### Detailed Component Descriptions

#### UI Component

- **API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/EditPatientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt=”EditPatientSequenceDiagram” />

#### Design Considerations

**Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Implement an Edit-by-Cloning Strategy

- _Pros_:
  - **Scalability:** By cloning the `Person` object before editing, the system is better equipped to handle future enhancements that may require complex transactional operations.
  - **Data Integrity:** This method ensures that the original `Person` object remains unaltered during the edit process, which reduces the risk of data corruption in the event of an operation failure.
- _Cons_:
  - Adds complexity and has potential performance issues.

**Alternative 2**: Modify the `Person` object directly

- _Pros_:
  - **Simplicity:** This straightforward approach requires less code, making it easier to implement and understand.
  - **Efficiency:** Operating directly on the `Person` object without cloning can be more performant, especially when dealing with simple edits that do not span multiple data fields.
- _Cons_:
  - **Limited Flexibility:** Direct modification constrains the ability to extend the system with complex transactional features or undo/redo capabilities without significant refactoring.
  - **Data Risk:** Without the safeguard of working on a cloned instance, there's a higher risk of inadvertently corrupting data during edit operations.

By considering these alternatives, the development team has chosen to prioritize a robust foundation for future development and data integrity, despite the trade-offs in complexity and potential impact on performance.

<puml src="diagrams/EditRecordSequenceDiagram.puml" alt=”EditRecordSequenceDiagram” />

#### Design Considerations

Similar to editing patient, a clone is created and modified, and then replaces the original.

**Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Clone the `Record` object, modify the clone, and then replace the original.

- _Pros_:

  - **Data Integrity:** By working on a clone, we minimize the risk of corrupting the original data in case of an error during the update process.
  - **Undo/Redo Capability:** This approach allows for an easier implementation of undo/redo functionalities as we have distinct before and after states.
  - **Consistency:** It maintains a consistent methodology with the editpatient command, which uses a similar approach for updating patient details.

- _Cons_:
  - **Performance Overhead:** Cloning objects can introduce a performance hit, especially if the record is large or if there are many fields to update.
  - **Complexity:** The codebase complexity increases due to the additional steps required to manage the cloning and replacement process.

**Alternative 2:** Update the `Record` object directly.

- _Pros_:
  - **Performance:** This approach is more performant since it involves direct manipulation of the object without the need to create a copy.
  - **Simplicity:** The logic is more straightforward, as it doesn't involve cloning, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- _Cons_:
  - **Risk to Data Integrity:** Any errors during the update can corrupt the original data, as changes are made in place.
  - **Difficulty in Extending Functionality:** Future features such as undo/redo or real-time collaboration could be harder to implement as changes are not isolated.

In conclusion, the decision to proceed with Alternative 1 was made to prioritize the application's long-term robustness and maintainability, accepting the trade-offs in performance and immediate simplicity for the sake of a safer and more extensible editing feature.

3. **User File Press**: `RecordCard#handleOpenFile(ActionEvent)` opens the file.

#### Alternative Considerations

In designing this feature, we considered two primary approaches:

1. **Current Implementation (GUI)**:

   - _Pros_: The graphical user interface (GUI) for file attachments is user-friendly, especially for individuals less familiar with command-line interfaces (CLI).
   - _Cons_: It may be relatively slower for users proficient with CLI-based interactions.

2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - _Pros_: CLI-based file attachment would cater to users who prefer efficient, command-driven workflows.
   - _Cons_: May require a learning curve for users less experienced with command-line interactions.

Ultimately, the decision was made to implement the feature with a GUI to ensure accessibility and ease of use for a broader range of users, while still allowing for efficient management of patient records.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### Design Considerations

**Alternative 1 (Current Choice)**: Each `Person` consists of a `UniqueAppointmentList` consisting of all `Appointment` objects assigned to the `Person`. Each `Appointment` object has the corresponding `Person` `NRIC` as a field.

- _Pros_:

  - **Direct Relationship**: It directly associates appointments with the individual patient, reflecting a real-world scenario where a patient has a list of their appointments.
  - **Ease of Access**: Retrieving all appointments for a specific person is straightforward.

- _Cons_:
  - **Duplication**: Storing `NRIC` in both `Person` and `Appointment` leads to data duplication, going against the principles of data normalization.
  - **Data Integrity Risks**: If an `NRIC` needs to be updated, it must be changed in each Appointment object, increasing the risk of data inconsistency.
  - **Complexity**: It complicates the retrieval of information about the `Person` associated with the `Appointment` such as trying to display the `Person` `Name` in the **Appointment Card**.

**Alternative 2**: Each `Appointment` consists of a a `Person` objects. Each `Person` object has the corresponding `Appointment` id as a field.

- _Pros_:

  - **Data Normalization**: This approach avoids duplicating person-specific data (like `NRIC`) within the appointment, adhering to data normalization principles.

- _Cons_:

  - **Complexity**: It complicates the retrieval of all appointments for a single person, requiring more complex queries and potentially impacting performance.
  - **Data Redundancy**: If an appointments holds a `Person` object, there's a risk of redundancy as the same `Person` object could be stored across multiple appointments.
  - **Difficult Person Creation**: The dependency of `Person` creation on `Appointment` objects complicates the process, potentially leading to issues when a new patient is registered without an appointment.

Considering MedBook's primary focus on patient management, **Alternative 1** has been selected. This decision prioritizes the ease and intuitiveness of accessing and managing patient-specific information, despite some level of data redundancy, which is often a trade-off in software design for enhanced usability.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

### Additional Navigation in Appointment Calender

#### Current Implementation

The current version of the Appointment Calendar allows users to view appointments in a calendar format. Navigation through the calendar is limited to sequential month traversal using 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. This implementation, while functional, can be cumbersome for users who wish to view appointments that are several months away from the current date.

#### Proposed Enhancement

We plan to enhance the calendar navigation by introducing a more efficient way for users to view appointments. The enhancement will allow users to:

**Manual Selection of Month and Year**: A dropdown menu or a picker control will be integrated into the UI, enabling users to quickly jump to a specific month and year without sequentially navigating through each month.

**`viewcalender MM YYYY` command**: For users who prefer typing through the CLI, we will implement a command that allows them to view the calendar for a specific month and year. Users will be able to enter a command in the format viewcalendar MM YYYY (e.g., viewcalendar 12 2023 to view December 2023), and the calendar will update to display the selected month and year.

---

### Enhanced Appointment Calender UI

#### Current Implementation

The existing UI of the Appointment Calendar displays a truncated version of the appointment name and limits the visible appointments to only two per day. This restriction can lead to incomplete information visibility which is not optimal for efficiency and user experience.

#### Proposed Enhancement

To improve the user interface and overall user experience of the Appointment Calendar, the following enhancements are proposed:

**Expanded Appointment Visibility**: Modify the calendar layout to allow for the display of more than two appointments per day. This could involve redesigning the day cells to accommodate more entries or implementing a scrolling mechanism within each day cell for days with numerous appointments.
Ensure that the UI remains uncluttered and user-friendly, even with the inclusion of more appointment entries per day.

**Full Appointment Name Display**: Adjust the UI to display the full name of each appointment, rather than a truncated version. This will enable users to quickly identify appointments at a glance without needing to hover over or click into the appointment for full details.
Implement a dynamic text resizing or wrapping feature within each calendar entry to ensure that longer appointment names fit within the allocated space without compromising readability.

**Responsive and Adaptive Design**: Enhance the calendar’s responsive design so it adapts effectively to different screen sizes and resolutions. This ensures that the increased information density does not negatively impact users on smaller screens or mobile devices.

### Enhanced NRIC Parameter for Patients

#### Current Implementation

In the current implementation the NRIC parameter for patient identification is limited in its format. It accepts an entry consisting of an alphabet, followed by seven digits, and then another alphabet. This format, while broadly useful, does not align completely with real-world scenarios, particularly in Singapore, and lacks the flexibility required for foreign patients.

#### Proposed Enhancement

To make the NRIC parameter more inclusive and reflective of real-world use cases, especially in Singapore, we propose enhancing the NRIC parameter with the following features:

**Restricted First Alphabet**: The first alphabet in the NRIC will now be restricted to specific letters, such as 'S' and 'T', which are currently used in Singapore. This change aligns the system more closely with the actual format of NRICs in Singapore.

**Optional Passport Number Support**: To accommodate foreign patients who do not have an NRIC, the system will be enhanced to accept passport numbers as an alternative identifier. This feature is particularly important for private clinics that cater to a diverse patient base, including non-residents and tourists.

---

### Accepting `/` in Name parameter

#### Current Implementation

Due to current constraints in the Parser which causes / to be parsed as tags, the "/" character cannot be entered into the name parameter. As such, users would currently not be able to enter "Muhammed Ali s/o Muhammed Ali".

#### Proposed Enhancement

Modify the parsing logic to differentiate between command tags and legitimate use of special characters in names. This could involve implementing an escape character mechanism or a more advanced parsing algorithm that can contextually understand the use of "/" in different scenarios.

---

### Patient Index Alignment

#### Current Implementation

The Patient ID in the patients in the **Pinned Patient List** and **Patient Being Viewed** is unaligned with the **Patient List** which might lead to confusion in users for which Patient ID to follow.

#### Proposed Enhancement

Modify the way panels create new person card entries. This could involve creating new lists to keep track of the patient index and update commands associated with the Pinned Patients and Patient Being Viewed.

## Appendix: Effort

This appendix aims to an insight into the total effort that went into the development of Medbook.

### Effort Overview

**Duration:** The project spanned approximately 2 months from initial conception to final release.
**Team:** Consisted of 5 members.

#### Technical Complexity and Challenges

- **Data Security:** Implementing robust security measures such as data encryption to protect sensitive patient information was paramount and required extensive research and testing. (It was omitted due to constraints related to the Project)
- **Defensive Coding:** We enforced immutability of `Person`, `Record`, and `Appointment` to maintain data integrity.
- **User Interface:** Crafting an intuitive GUI that also supported a CLI for efficiency demanded iterative design and usability testing.

#### Effort Quantification

- **Development:** The team invested over 300 hours in coding, with a focused effort on crafting intuitive and responsive GUI and CLI interfaces. This investment reflects our commitment to usability and accessibility, ensuring that both novice and experienced users can navigate the application with ease.

- **Testing:** More than 100 hours were dedicated to a combination of manual and automated testing. This rigorous testing protocol was critical in validating the application's reliability and optimizing its performance across various user scenarios and system environments.

- **Documentation:** We allocated 50 hours to developing thorough user documentation. This comprehensive guide is pivotal for facilitating a quick adoption of the application by new users and serves as a reliable reference for existing users to leverage the application's full potential.

#### Reuse of Existing Solutions

- **Library Reuse:** Utilized the JavaFX library for the GUI, which saved much effort for front-end development.

#### Effort Comparison with Reference Projects:

- **Compared to AB3:** the development of Medbook demanded considerably more effort, primarily due to its capability to manage multiple entity types such as patients, records, and appointments. This multifaceted approach contrasts with AB3's design, which is centered around handling a single entity type.
  Moreover, Medbook was built upon the AB3 architecture as a foundational base, necessitating a deep understanding of the existing complex framework. Even though certain features in Medbook were adapted from AB3 to suit our specific needs, significant effort was required to modify and extend these features. Tailoring pre-existing functionalities to fit into our more comprehensive application model involved intricate work, ensuring seamless integration and functionality within Medbook's broader scope.

#### Achievements

- Despite the high complexity, the team managed to deliver Medbook on schedule.
- User feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, especially regarding the ease of use and performance of the application.

#### Conclusion

The successful development of Medbook is a testament to the well-coordinated effort, rigorous testing, and effective project management that adapted to challenges and complexity with innovative solutions and strategic planning.
