### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java))
is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API
`interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled
to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` objects residing in the
`Model`.

### Logic component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn
creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
`Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
`ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores an `observableAppointments` object that represents existing appointments in the address book, sorted in a
chronological order.
* stores a `sortedAppointments` object that represents existing appointments in the address book.
* `observableAppointments` and `sortedAppointments` depend on `filteredPersons`. Hence, appointments listed are for
`Person` objects in `filteredPersons`.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Overview of How Commands Work

The basic idea of what happens when a user types a command:
1. The LogicManager executes method is called and takes in the user's input.
2. The user's input is then parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which then creates the respective `XYZCommandParser`.
3. `XYZCommandParser` parses the additional arguments provided by the user and creates and `XYZCommand`.
4. `XYZCommand` then communicates with ModelManager to execute and returns a `CommandResult` which is displayed to the user.


The flow of how a `Command` is executed is illustrated with the `Schedule` Command below.
### Schedule Command

#### Implementation Overview
After the `AddressBookParser` identifies that the user's input has a schedule command word, it creates a
`ScheduleCommandParser`. The `ScheduleCommandParser` then parses the users input and creates a new `ScheduleCommand`
containing an `Appointment` and an `Index`. The `ScheduleCommand` is then executed by `Logic Manager`, which updates
the `Person` in `Model` to have the created `Appointment`. A `CommandResult` which stores the message of the outcome
of schedule command is then returned. The partial class diagram is shown below.

<img src="images/ScheduleClassDiagram.png" width="400"/>


In the event the `Person` already has an existing appointment, a different instance of `CommandResult` is instantiated. This
instance invokes the constructor that contains the `Person` as well as the new proposed `Appointment`. The returned
`CommandResult` instead results in the UI being notified that while the `ScheduleCommand` has been executed, the user
should be prompted to confirm this change on the `OverrideWindow` of the UI. Only after confirmation of this is the
overriding of the appointment completed using the appointment and person stored in the `CommandResult`. In the event of
cancelling the override, the program resumes its functionality, effectively discarding the execution of the rest of the
`scheduleCommand`

The following activity diagram summarises what happens the user executes a schedule command.

<img src="images/ScheduleActivityDiagram.png" width="400"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to implement appointment for Person**

Alternative 1 (Current Choice): Create an abstract class ScheduleItem and make it a compulsory field for Person.

The diagram below illustrates our current implementation. A `Person` has is associated with 1 `ScheduleItem`, which can be a `NullAppointment`(empty appointment) or `Appointment`.

<img src="images/ScheduleItemClassDiagram.png" width="300"/>

- Pros:
  * This ensures a 1-to-1 relationship between Person and Appointment, making implementation of other functions like
  sort easier. This also prevents clutter of appointments in the UI.
  * This makes use of a **facade** design pattern, where `NullAppointment` and `Appointment` will handle themselves
  without the `Person` knowing.

- Cons:
  * This makes the scheduling of Appointments more inflexible, as the FA is unable to schedule multiple appointments
  with the same person.

- Other considerations:
  * `NullAppointment` is a Singleton class to prevent multiple instances of it being created, making it more efficient for memory.

Alternative 2: Create a hashset of Appointments for each Person.
- Pros:
  * More flexible, user can now schedule multiple appointment for a Person.

- Cons:
  * Harder to implement operations such as editing of an appointment for a client. An additional step of finding the
  specified appointment within the hashset is required, which may potentially introduce more bugs.
  * Harder to implement default behaviours for when person has no appointment.


**Aspect: How to implement override prompt**

Alternative 1(current solution): Create a separate constructor in CommandResult to handle overriding.
- Pros:
  * Easy to implement.
  * This "freezes" functionality of the program to force user to acknowledge or cancel the execution of the command.
- Cons:
  * This creates multiple different constructors within the CommandResult.

Alternative 2: Abstract CommandResult to get a successfulExecutionResult and a PausedExecutionResult.
- Pros:
  * Improves code readability and reduces coupling in code.
- Cons:
  * Time-consuming to refactor code
  * Improper implementation could result in breaking of coding principles.
- Note:
  * With additional time, alternative 2 can be implemented by refactoring the code to create multiple subclasses. Be wary of the
    Liskov Substitution Principle  (LSP) when doing so. The earlier alternative 2 is implemented, the better to reduce amount of code
    that needs to be refactored.
  * The above implementation can be done in conjunction with the clear command prompt to reduce code coupling.

### Complete Feature

#### Implementation Overview

The **Complete** feature is facilitated by the `CompleteCommand` and `CompleteCommandParser`. The
`CompleteCommandParser` creates a `CompleteByIndex` or `CompleteByDate` object depending on the user's input. Both `CompleteByIndex` and `CompleteByDate` extends `CompleteCommand` as illustrated in the class diagram below.

<img src="images/CompleteClassDiagram.png" width="400"/>

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the complete operation is executed when date given.

<img src="images/CompleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="800"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: The lifeline of the diagram should end at the destroyer mark (X) but reaches end of diagram due to limitation of plantUML.
</div>

The following activity diagram illustrates how the complete operation is executed.

<img src="images/CompleteActivityDiagram.png" width="800"/>

#### Design Considerations

Alternative 1 (Previous Design): Use a `CompleteCommandDescriptor` that has a `Date` and `Index` field wrapped by Java `Optional`.

* Pros:
  * Allows for clean, readable code without having to check for null values regardless of whether user inputs a date or index.

* Cons:
  * Have to check for both fields for at every step of the command which is inefficient.

Alternative 2 (Current Choice): Make `CompleteCommand` an abstract class with the subclass `CompleteByIndex` and `CompletebyDate`.

* Pros:
  * `LogicManager` can just execute `CompleteCommand` without needing to know if it is `CompleteByIndex` or `CompleteByDate`.
  * Also eliminates the need to check for null fields, since each `CompleteCommand` subclass only has their required fields.
  * This also increases the extensibility of the command, as a new subclass can just be added.

* Cons:
  * Increases the amount of code written and testing required.

### Gather Emails Feature

The **Gather Emails** feature in our software system is designed to efficiently collect email addresses. This feature is facilitated by the `GatherCommand` and `GatherCommandParser`. Below is the class diagram of the `gather emails` feature.

![GatherClassDiagram](images/GatherClassDiagram.png)

#### Implementation Overview

The `GatherCommand` is initiated by the `GatherCommandParser`. The `GatherCommandParser` parses the arguments and creates either a `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan` or `GatherEmailByTag` object respectively.
Both `GatherEmailByFinancialPlan` or `GatherEmailByTag` implements the `GatherEmailPrompt` interface.

The `GatherCommand` takes in the `GatherEmailPrompt` object and passes it into the current `Model`, subsequently interacting with the `AddressBook` class.
The `GatherCommand#execute()` executes the gather operation by calling `Model#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the gather operation works as described above:

![GatherSequenceDiagram1](images/GatherSequenceDiagram1.png)

The `ModelManager#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)` calls the `AddressBook#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)` method, which subsequently calls the `UniquePersonsList#gatherEmails(GatherEmailsPrompt prompt)` method.

The `UniquePersonsList` class maintains a list of unique persons. The `UniquePersonsList` class implements the following operation:

- `UniquePersonsList#gatherEmails(GatherEmailPrompt prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Iterates through the persons list and calls `GatherEmailPrompt#gatherEmails(Person person)`, passing in each person.

Depending on the type of `GatherEmailPrompt`, the method above triggers either:

- `Person#gatherEmailsContainsTag(String prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if the given prompt is a substring of any `Tag` names in the `Set<Tag>` of the current person.
- `Person#gatherEmailsContainsFinancialPlan(String prompt)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks if the given prompt is a substring of any `FinancialPlan` names in the `Set<FinancialPlan>` of the current person.

These methods internally utilize `Tag#containsSubstring(String substring)` and `FinancialPlan#containsSubstring(String substring)`, respectively. These substring comparisons are performed in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the prompt and the `FinancialPlan` or `Tag` names to lowercase before the check.
By allowing partial input, users can efficiently find email addresses associated with lengthy `Tag` or `FinancialPlan` names. The case-insensitive approach enhances user-friendliness, ensuring consistent and reliable results, regardless of input case.

Currently, we only allow gathering emails by `FinancialPlan` and `Tag` fields as these are the more likely to be searched to gather emails by. However, additional classes implementing the `GatherEmailPrompt` interface can be added to enable the gathering of emails based on a broader range of fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the gather emails by `FinancialPlan` field operation works:

![GatherSequenceDiagram2](images/GatherSequenceDiagram2.png)

The following activity diagram illustrates how the complete operation is executed:

![GatherClassActivityDiagram](images/GatherClassActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How many inputs to accept**
* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** User can only search by one `FinancialPlan` or `Tag`.
  * **Pros:** Easy to implement. Limits the potential for bugs.
  * **Cons:** Limited filtering options.

* **Alternative 2:** User can search by multiple `FinancialPlan` and `Tag` fields.
  * **Pros:** More flexible (e.g. gathering by a combination of `FinancialPlan` and `Tag`).
  * **Cons:** Introduces more complexity and requires additional error handling.


### Expanded Find feature

The enhanced find mechanism is facilitated by the `CombinedPredicate` and utilises the existing `FindCommand` structure.

#### Implementation Overview

Here's a sequence diagram that demonstrates how `FindCommand` works:

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The `CombinedPredicate` class gives the `find` command the ability to search for multiple terms at once, implemented using an array
of `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`. Here's a partial class diagram of the `CombinedPredicate`.

![CombinedPredicateClassDiagram](images/CombinedPredicateClassDiagram.png)

All `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` classes (e.g., `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate`, ...) inherit from the `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` interface so that
they can be treated similarly in the `CombinedPredicate` class.

Note that only `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` checks for whole words, because it is rare to search for people by
substrings e.g. `Marc` and `Marcus` should not show up in the same search. On the other hand,
`FinancialPlanContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate` allow matching for
substrings because there are certain cases where it is logical to search for substrings e.g. `Plan A` and
`Plan A Premium` are related, so they can show up in the same search.

The `find` command format also changes to resemble a format more similar to the `add` and `edit` commands, to allow for
searching for keywords in multiple fields at the same time. We also allow the use of duplicate prefixes so that we
can search for multiple terms belonging to the same field.

For now, we only allow for searching for `Name`, `FinancialPlan` and `Tag` fields because they are the most commonly
searched fields, but extending the feature to search in other fields is possible by creating the appropriate
`Predicate` class and modifying the `FindCommandParser`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to implement find for multiple fields**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one unified command and format.
    * Pros: Easy to implement (argument multimap is available), allows for more flexible usage.
    * Cons: May get cluttered when there are many terms.

* **Alternative 2:** Take an argument to decide which field to find by.
    * Pros: More user-friendly and natural since there is no need to use prefixes.
    * Cons: Less flexible, slightly more difficult to implement.

**Aspect: How to implement `CombinedPredicate`**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `varargs` and a common interface.
    * Pros: More flexible in usage while still testable.
    * Cons: More difficult to modify and the check for equality can be defeated with enough effort.

* **Alternative 2:** Compose it with the 3 component predicates.
    * Pros: Easier to modify and test.
    * Cons: Less flexible when trying to combine multiple predicates (that may be of the same type).

* **Alternative 3:** Use a `Predicate<Person>` and use the `or()` method to chain predicates.
    * Pros: More flexible in usage.
    * Cons: More difficult to modify and test.

### Sort Feature

The **Sort** feature in our software system is designed to sort the list of clients by name as well as appointment
time. This feature is facilitated through the `SortCommand` class.

#### Implementation Overview

The following diagram summarises what happens when the user executes a sort command:

<img src="images/SortClassActivityDiagram.png" width="700"/>

The `SortCommand` class is instantiated by the `SortCommandParser`, which parses user input commands. The
`SortCommandParser` class implements the following operations:

- `SortCommandParser#parse(String args)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Checks the sort command keyword passed in by the user.

The `SortCommand` takes in a `Comparator<Person>` object and passes it into the current `Model` model. The
`SortCommand` class implements the following operations:

- `SortCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the sort operation by calling `model.sortFilteredPersonList(comparator)`.

The `Model` interface is implemented by the `ModelManager`, representing the in-memory model of the address book data.
It contains the following method:

- ModelManager#sortFilteredPersonList(Comparator<Person> comparator)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Carries out the sorting operation by
setting the comparator on the list of clients wrapped in a SortedList wrapper.

A `CommandResult` class is created and returned.

<img src="images/SortClassSequenceDiagram.png" width = "700"/>


#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Sort Executes**

**Alternative 1(current choice):** User can sort by name and appointment at any time. As such, calling find on the sorted list will result
in the ordering of find to also be sorted.
- Pros: Improved usability of maintaining order of list throughout without the list having to be reordered after
each command.
- Cons: Limited sorting options as of now.


### Appointment List Feature

#### Implementation Overview

The appointment list is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and stores an additional `SortedList<Appointment>` object that represents all existing appointments.
The `setAppointmentList()` method checks against `filteredPersons` to look for updates regarding existing `Appointment` objects. The `setAppointmentList()` method is called whenever there is a command that can potentially change the data stored, to ensure that the state of the appointment list is as updated as possible.

The `getAppointmentList()` method is called once during the startup of the program by `getAppointmentList()` in `LogicManager`, which is in turn called by `MainWindow`. It returns the `sortedList<Appointment>` object within `modelManager`.

Do note that appointments are inherently sorted by their date and time, with the earliest appointment showing up at the top.

The following sequence diagram shows how the appointment list is updated. The `setPerson()` method is being called in the `ScheduleCommand#execute()` method. The `ModelManager#addToAppointmentIfPresent()` method adds an `Appointment` object into the `ObservableList<Appointment>` if the `Person` object in `filteredPersons` has a `scheduleItem` object that is an instance of `Appointment`.

<img src="images/AppointmentListSequenceDiagram.png" width="700"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where to create** `SortedList<Appointment>`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement it within `modelManager`
    - Pros: `SortedAppointments` object references `filteredPersons` which ensures that the appointment list
    corresponds with `persons` from `addressBook`. In this implementation, `persons` acts as the single source of truth which provides all information to `modelManager`.
    - Cons: Errors with respect to `addressBook` will affect the appointment list rendered.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement it within `addressBook`
    - Pros: `persons` and `appointmentList` are handled separately within. `addressBook` and hence the appointment
    list is not dependent on `persons` in `addressBook`.
    - Cons: `filteredPersons` and `sortedAppointments` might not correspond since `sortedAppointments` is no longer
    dependent on `filteredPersons`.

**Aspect: How to update appointment list**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**
Empty `appointmentList` and populate the list when there is a command that can potentially update it.
    - Pros: Easy to implement.
    - Cons: Time complexity might not be optimal if the application is dealing with large amounts of data.
* **Alternative 2:**
Based on specific index that user inputs for commands, update `appointmentList` accordingly.
    - Pros: Time complexity will be optimal and will not deterioriate with increasing amounts of data.
    - Cons: More difficult to test.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with typing speed of above 80WPM for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should
be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  A user should be able to have up to 2000 clients.
5.  The product is offered as a free offline service.
6.  The codebase should be well-documented to aid in future maintenance and updates.
7.  Should continue working despite invalid commands and error messages should be shown to the user.
8.  All features added to the code should be tested.
9.  All commands should be able to be executed by a financial advisor with little technical knowledge.

### Planned Enhancements
1. The current `schedule` command does not check if the given date is before the current date, so it is vulnerable to
user error. We plan to make the command check for the date and fail if the date is before the current date: `Date given
 cannot be before the current date`.
2. The current `phone` and `next-of-kin phone` fields currently only accepts numbers. It cannot accept international
number formats. We plan to make the fields accept symbols so numbers such as `+6598765432` and `001-234-1-4610818`
will be accepted. This will involve changing the validity checker for both fields.
3. The current contact book does not check for duplicates beyond the exact matching of the person's `name`.
We plan to refuse adding/editing of a person's details if it results in two people sharing a `name` (case-insensitive)
or `phone` since two people are very unlikely to share those details.
4. The current `name` and `next-of-kin name` fields currently do not accept symbols. We plan to make the fields accept
symbols so that names like `Thaarshen s/o Thaarshen` and `O'Brien` are accepted. This will involve changing the
validity checker for both fields.
5. The current `gather` command does not allow the gathering of all emails in the contact book or by multiple fields
at once. To allow the gathering of all the persons emails using `gather all` command, we plan create another
`GatherEmailPrompt` class, with a method that will call the Person `getEmail()` method. To allow gathering emails by multiple fields, for example using the `fp/` and `t/` prefixes at once, we plan to use a similar approach
to `find` but return the person's email instead.
6. The `clear` command confirmation window can be manipulated using the arrow and 'Enter' keys. The window is
initialised with the focus on the `confirm` button. This makes it possible for a user to accidentally press 'Enter'
twice and wipe the contact book anyway, bypassing the defence mechanism entirely. We plan to make the command more
resistant to mistakes by having the user key in a specific phrase, or to initialise the window with the focus on the
`cancel` button instead.
7. The `schedule` and `complete` command current uses the same `d/` prefix but the format for the arguments is different for both. We plan to update add a new `dt/` prefix to represent date-time arguments for `schedule` command to prevent confusion for the users.

## **Appendix: Effort**
This project required a substantial effort to design and implement various features aimed at enhancing
the functionality of the software system. It was quite hard at the beginning because we were not well-versed with the
codebase. After understanding some pertinent classes to implement our enhancements, we also had to refactor and
add test cases to ensure the functionalities of our enhancements.

In v1.2, we implemented the Sort command to allow users to sort his clients' contacts in alphabetical order with
respect to their names, or with respect to their appointment time in chronological order. This posed a significant
challenge as there was no clear documentation that provided aid as to how we should implement both the filtering function (via
the find command) and the sort command at the same time. We had to spend time understanding the inner workings of
JavaFX's `filteredList` and `sortedList` classes to finally come up with a solution to return a sorted and filtered
list of clients.

In v1.3, we updated the GUI to include an appointment list to show upcoming appointments that clients have with the
financial advisor. We found out that the appointment list is not properly updated when there are changes made to the
data, and they are only updated upon restarting the application. We had to spend time understanding how the Observer
Pattern works so that changes to the appointment list are being reflected instantaneously.

Moreover, we decided to implement safety features like the clear and override prompts that prevent accidental command executions
by the user. This required having to trace the entire code logic to understand how commands were executed and also how to
pause and split execution of commands to make sure that no bugs were introduced into the code.

The project's difficulty level was notably high due to the complexity of implementing features such as scheduling
appointments, gathering emails, expanded find functionality, sorting, and the introduction of an appointment list.
