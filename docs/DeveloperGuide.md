### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<br>
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<br>
How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ProfPlanParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ProfPlanParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ProfPlanParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/UmlForModel.png" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ProfPlan`, which `Task` references. This allows `ProfPlan` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/profplan/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both tasklist data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ProfPlanStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `profplan.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


## DoNext feature
### Actual implementation
- The DoNext feature in ProfPlan allows users to generate a recommendation of which task to do next.
- We compute (priority) / (number of days to due date) for every task, and select the task with the highest computed value as the recommendation.
- This is because a task is recommended if it has higher priority and lower number of days left to due date.
- Below, we describe the implementation details for this feature through a (partial) UML class and state diagram:


The `DoNextCommand` is a part of the ProfPlan application, a task management tool. It allows users to generate next task recommendation. It is one of the standout features of ProfPlan, as it generates smart recommendations for professors.

### Code Structure
The code structure for the `DoNextCommand` is well-organized. It consists of the following components:
- `DoNextCommand` class: Represents the command itself.
- `ProfPlanParser` class: Responsible for parsing user input and creating `DoNextCommand` instances.
- `Priority` class: Represents the priority of a task (from 1 to 10).
- `DueDate` class: Represents the deadline of a task (in dd-MM-yyyy format, e.g. '01-02-2023').
- `Task` class: Represents a task, and it contains the priority and dueDate that `DoNextCommand` processes.
- `ModelManager` class: contains the `getDoNextTask()` function to generate recommended task.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Mark feature
### Actual implementation
The Mark feature in ProfPlan allows users to set a task as done. Below, we describe the implementation details for this feature through a (partial) UML class diagram:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 5px;">
        <img src="images/MarkCommandClassDiagram.png" alt="MarkCommand Class Diagram" width="380">
    </div>
</div>


The `MarkCommand` is a part of the ProfPlan application, a task management tool. The `MarkCommand` allows users to mark a task as done by specifying the task index. It is a critical part of the application's functionality, as it helps users manage and track their tasks efficiently.

### Sequence Diagram <a name="sequence-diagram"></a>
The sequence diagram below provides an overview of how the `MarkCommand` is executed and interacts with other components.

![Sequence Diagram](images/MarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:
1. The `LogicManager` receives the command "mark 1" from the user.
2. The `ProfPlanParser` parses the command and recognizes it as a `MarkCommand`.
3. The `MarkCommandParser` parses the argument "1" and creates a `MarkCommand`.
4. The `MarkCommand` is executed.
5. The `Model` is updated by marking the task as done.
6. A `CommandResult` is created to provide feedback to the user.
7. The result is returned to the `LogicManager`.

3. The application will provide feedback, indicating the successful marking of the task as done.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Filter feature
### Actual implementation
The Filter feature in ProfPlan allows users to filter according to one or more of the following criteria:
- `DueDate`: displays tasks before given due date
- `Priority`: displays tasks of given priority
- `Status`: displays tasks of given status
- `RecurringType`: displays tasks of given recurring type

Below, we describe the implementation details for this feature through a (partial )UML class diagram:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 5px;">
        <img src="images/FilterCommandClassDiagram.png" alt="FilterCommand Class Diagram" width="800px">
    </div>
</div>


The `FilterCommand` is a part of the ProfPlan application, a task management tool. The `FilterCommand` allows users to filter tasks by due date, priority, and status. This enables clearer visualisation of tasks.

### Code Structure

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the `FilterCommand` in the ProfPlan application, you can execute the following steps:

1. Enter the "filter" command followed by "d/", "p/", "s/" and/or "recur/", for DueDate, Priority, Status and RecurringType respectively. Then, input the value of predicate, which must follow the formats of the criteria:
    - DueDate: a date in the format dd-MM-yyyy
    - Priority: an Integer from 1 to 10 inclusive
    - Status: "done" or "undone
    - RecurringType: "none", "daily", "weekly", "monthly", or "semesterly"
For example, "filter d/01-01-2023 s/undone" filters for tasks before and on 01-01-2023 that are undone.

2. The `FilterCommand` will filter the task list in the model according to the predicate(s) applied.

3. The application will provide feedback, indicating the successful filtering, and display the relevant tasks.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Help for Commands feature

The detail listing mechanism is facilitated by the `HelpCommandParser` class, which implements the `Parser` interface. This `HelpCommandParser` overrides the `parse()` method in `Parser` and creates either an empty `HelpCommand`, or a `HelpCommand` with a `COMMAND_WORD` as a String. For example `help` or `help delete`.

Hence, this will be facilitated by overloading the constructor in `HelpCommand` to either create an empty `HelpCommand`, or a `HelpCommand` with a `COMMAND_WORD`:
* When an empty `HelpCommand` executes `execute()`, a `CommandResult` with `MESSAGE_USAGE` of all commands will be created.
* When a `HelpCommand` with a `COMMAND_WORD` executes `execute()`, a `CommandResult` with the `MESSAGE_DETAIL` of the `Command` specified by the `COMMAND_WORD` will be created.

The following activity diagram shows how the Help Command works:

![HelpActivityDiagram](images/HelpActivity.png)

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store `Command` details:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Store Command Details in each command.**

  * Pros: Follows OOP principles.

  * Cons: Changes will need to be propagated in Command Usage and Details format to all Commands individually.

* **Alternative 2: Store all Command Details in a separate class.**

  * Pros: Centralised area to view all Messages.

  * Cons: Does not follow OOP principles. Future implementations that tap on these Details will take longer to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Displaying statistics

The statistics mechanism requires support from `Model`, which will provide `StatsCommand` the required statistics. Currently, this is done using a public getter `getCompletionRate()`.

When `StatsCommand` executes `execute()`, it calls this getter and returns a new `CommandResult` containing a formatted `String`, with the statistics retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the stats command works:

![StatsSequenceDiagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

Here's a breakdown of the sequence:
1. The `LogicManager` receives the command "stats" from the user.
1. The `ProfPlanParser` parses the command and creates a `StatsCommand`.
1. The `StatsCommand` is executed by `LogicManager`.
1. The getter, `getCompletionRate()`, is called on `Model`.
1. `Model` returns a `double` containing the completion rate.
1. A `CommandResult` is created and formatted to provide feedback to the user.
1. The result is returned to the `LogicManager`.

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to retrieve statistics:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a public getter in Model.**

  * Pros: Simple and readable.

  * Cons: Exposes more of Model, which may result in unintended use by developers.

* **Alternative 2: Retrieve a copy of the task list and calculate statistics as such.**

  * Pros: List is not mutated. All calculations of Statistics is centralised under StatsCommand.

  * Cons: Does not follow OOP principles. Operations regarding the list should be handled by the list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProfPlan`. It extends `ProfPlan` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `profPlanStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProfPlan#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current tasklist state in its history.
* `VersionedProfPlan#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous tasklist state from its history.
* `VersionedProfPlan#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone tasklist state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProfPlan()`, `Model#undoProfPlan()` and `Model#redoProfPlan()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProfPlan` will be initialized with the initial task list state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single task list state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in the tasklist. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitProfPlan()`, causing the modified state of the task list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `profPlanStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted tasklist state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Grade assignment â€¦â€‹` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProfPlan()`, causing another modified tasklist state to be saved into the `ProfPlanStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProfPlan()`, so the tasklist state will not be saved into the `profPlanStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProfPlan()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous tasklist state, and restores the tasklist to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ProfPlan state, then there are no previous ProfPlan states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProfPlan()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoProfPlan()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the tasklist to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `profPlanStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest tasklist state, then there are no undone ProfPlan states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProfPlan()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the tasklist, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProfPlan()`, `Model#undoProfPlan()` or `Model#redoProfPlan()`. Thus, the `profPlanStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProfPlan()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `profPlanStateList`, all tasklist states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Grade assignment â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire tasklist.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## \[Proposed\] Task Archiving feature

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed task archiving function makes use of the `ArchivedProfPlan` class. It extends `ProfPlan`, storing a separate list of tasks that are archived.

In addition, the `ModelManager`, which implements `Model`, has to include `ArchivedProfPlan`, in addition to `ProfPlan`, as one of its fields.


#### 1. Archiving tasks

This is supported by the `ArchiveCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `ArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Archives the selected task, i.e. deleting it from ProfPlan and adding it to ArchivedProfPlan.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#archiveTask(Task target)`.

To parse the Archive Command, there is the `ArchiveCommandParser` that implements `Parser`, which supports this main operation:

* `ArchiveCommandParser#parse(String args)` â€” Parses the user input to return an `ArchiveCommand`.
  * Valid arguments: Integers (task index), or "all"


The sequence diagram below shows how archiving a task works.

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 2. List archived tasks

This is supported by the `ListArchivesCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `ListArchivesCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Displays all archived tasks.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#getArchivedTasks()`.


The sequence diagram below shows how displaying archived tasks works.

![ListArchivesSequenceDiagram](images/ListArchivesSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 3. Delete archived tasks

This uses similar implementation as the delete function on ProfPlan, but acting on ArchivedProfPlan instead.

It is supported by the `DeleteArchiveCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `DeleteArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the selected task from ArchivedProfPlan.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#deleteArchive(Task target)`.

To parse the DeleteArchive Command, there is the `DeleteArchiveCommandParser` that implements `Parser`, which supports this main operation:

* `DeleteArchiveCommandParser#parse(String args)` â€” Parses the user input to return an `DeleteArchiveCommand`.
  * Valid arguments: Integers (task index), or "all"


#### 4. Restore archived tasks

This uses similar implementation as the archive function, but reversing ProfPlan and ArchivedProfPlan.

It is supported by the `RestoreArchiveCommand` that extends `Command`, and implements this main operation:

* `RestoreArchiveCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the selected archived task, i.e. deleting it from ArchivedProfPlan and adding it to ProfPlan.

This operation invodes a method in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#restoreArchiveTask(Task target)`.

To parse the Archive Command, there is the `RestoreArchiveCommandParser` that implements `Parser`, which supports this main operation:

* `RestoreArchiveCommandParser#parse(String args)` â€” Parses the user input to return an `RestoreArchiveCommand`.
  * Valid arguments: Integers (task index), or "all"


### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store archived tasks:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves archived tasks in a separate tasklist from the main ProfPlan, named ArchivedProfPlan.
  * Pros:
    * Better performance if many tasks are archived, and methods invoked on ProfPlan will not affect tasks in ArchivedProfPlan.
    * Clear segregation between archived and normal tasks.
  * Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Each task have an archive flag, which indicates whether they are archived. Archived tasks are not shown in the main ProfPlan.
  * Pros: Easier to implement as it is similar to tagging tasks.
  * Cons: Performance issues in the main ProfPlan if many tasks are archived.

## Appendix: Effort

### Overview

ProfPlan is an advanced task management application tailored specifically for computer science professors. This project extends the functionalities of AB3, introducing unique features that cater to the needs of the target audience. The development of ProfPlan posed significant challenges due to its extensive and dynamic features, necessitating a dedicated effort from our team.

### Challenges and Efforts

**1. Better task organisation**

To represent the complex tasks faced by professors, we added many additional parameters to a Task, building upon the foundation provided by AB3. Examples include due date, recurring type, and links. These features introduces further complexity in tracking and organisating tasks, and require an enhanced understanding of data structures and optimised coding designs.

It also serves as a basis for more sophisticated task organisation functions. One example is our robust system of sort and filter mechanisms. To ensure that tasks are presented to the user in an organized and meaningful way, we introduced a variety of commands and criteria that a task can be sort/filtered by. This required a thorough understanding of sorting mechanisms and backend activity.

**2. Custom algorithms**

The "Recommend next task" feature intelligently analyses tasks based on their priorities and due dates, to determine which task should be completed next. This necessitates the creation of a custom algorithm that compares and weighs the importance of tasks, while resolving ties and conflicts in a sophisticated manner.

In addition, the "View Task statistics" feature required intensive calculation and aggregation of data related to Tasks, namely their Status, in order to generate a meaningful task completion rate for users.


**3. UI Visualisation**

ProfPlan introduces the "Urgency-Priority Matrix", a novel visualization tool, to organise tasks based on its priority, and due date. Developing an intuitive and comprehensive UI display required a deep understanding of JavaFX and frontend development, as well as a keen eye for user experience design.


### Effort Saved Through Reuse

We reused components from AB3, particularly the foundational architecture and some basic UI elements. This reuse saved approximately 10% of our total development effort.


### Achievements

Despite the challenges, our team successfully delivered a fully functional and user-friendly application. Novel features like the Urgency-Priority Matrix and intelligent task recommendation have been well-received by our user base, demonstrating the software's practical utility for our target audience.

In summary, the development of ProfPlan was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor. The application's success stands as a testament to our team's dedication in software development.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Recommend next task:

More sophisticated tie-breaker mechanism can be implemented with Natural Language Processing. When tasks have the same priority and due date, the preferences of the user can be considered in determining which task is of higher importance.

### Link:

User input for the Link parameter of a Task should be verified for its validity as a URL. Links that are displayed in the UI should also redirect users to the specified URL upon clicking, instead of just being regular text.

### Visual indicators:

There can be colour-coding for tasks based on their priority, or tasks that are overdue. These visual aids will be helpful in alerting professors to more important, and overdue tasks.
