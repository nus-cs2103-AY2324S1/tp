## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

Here's a class diagram of the `Model` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<br> Below is a class diagram on the `Person` class and the classes related to its attributes:

<puml src="diagrams/PersonClassDiagram.puml" alt="PersonClassDiagram" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Notifications feature

#### Implementation

The notifications feature is centered around `Event` instances.
`Event` can represent any type of event with a specific date and time.
This could be a birthday, an upcoming meeting or a deadline.
`Event` also encapsulates timings where a reminder should be created.

On startup, `EventFactory#createEvents(model)` is used to generate `Event` instances from the initial state of the model.
Any future events can be added to the data model as well during runtime.

Three public methods for `Event` are important for its usage
* `Event#addMember(Person)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a `Person` as associated with this event.
* `Event#addReminder(Duration)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets a reminder for the event one `Duration` before the time of the actual event. For example, if `Duration` is set to a day, the reminder will be a day in advance.
* `Event#getNotificationAtTime(LocalDateTime)`â€‰â€”â€‰Check if any notifications should be generated based on a specific time, usually the current time should be passed as the parameter.

Below is the class diagram for the `Event` class and it's interactions with the other classes.

<puml src="diagrams/notification-system/ClassDiagram.puml" alt="NotificationClassDiagram" />

The startup sequence for creating initial events is given below as well.
On a high level, the `MainApp#initEvents()` will use `EventFactory#createEvents(model)` to generate `Event` instances from the intial state of the model, then add all of these events to the model.

<puml src="diagrams/notification-system/InitEventsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="InitEventsSequenceDiagram" />

Based on the `Event` instances present in the data model, you can call `Model#getLatestNotifications(LocalDateTime)`, passing in the current datetime, in order to get a list of `Notification` instances representing notifications that should be displayed to the user.
The UI system will make use of this API to check if any notifications should be displayed to the user at startup.

The flow for the startup notifications is described by the following sequence diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/notification-system/StartupNotificationsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="StartupNotificationsSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Generic design**

A generic event system was created, even though CampusConnect only requires a specific Birthday notification system at the moment.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generic event system.
  * Pros: Extensible for future types of Events and Notifications beyond birthdays.
  * Cons: More code required, and more indirection in code because of the generic nature.

* **Alternative 2:** Birthday notification system.
  * Pros: Simpler to implement, code will be more straightforward to understand as well.
  * Cons: Any future ideas to implement new notifications and events will not benefit from the existing implementation of the birthday notification system.


### AddAlt feature

#### Implementation Details

The `addalt` feature involves creating a new `Person` object with additional contact details to replace the previous `Person` object.
This is done using the `AddAltPersonDescriptor` class; `AddAltPersonDescriptor` object stores the additional contact information to be added to the previous `Person` object.

As a result, the existing `Person` class in AB3's implementation is enhanced to have the capacity of containing more attributes. The `Person` object is now composed of the following additional attributes due to the `addalt` feature on top of the existing attributes from AB3's implementation:

* `Email`: The secondary email address of the contact.
* `Linkedin`: The linkedin of the contact.
* `Telegram`: The telegram handle of the contact.
* `Birthday`: The birthday of the contact.

The [**`java.util.Optional<T>`**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html) class is utilised to encapsulate the optional logic of the above attributes.

To add these additional attributes into a `Person` object, an `INDEX` parameter, followed by the [prefixes](#prefix-summary) that represent the attributes needs to be specified for the `addalt` command.
`INDEX` represents the index number of the contact to be edited in the contact list.

<box type="info">

While all the fields are optional, at least one needs to be given to the `addalt` command.
</box>

The flow for the `addalt` command is described by the following sequence diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/AddAltSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddAltSequenceDiagram" />

#### Feature details
1. The application will validate the arguments supplied by the user; whether the `INDEX` provided is valid and each of the additional attribute input follows the pre-determined formats defined in their respective classes. It also checks that the added secondary email does not result in the contact to have duplicate emails.
2. If any of the inputs fails the validation check, an error message is provided with details of the input error and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If all of the inputs pass the validation check, a new `Person` objected with the updated attributes is created and stored in the `AddressBook`.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Generic design**

The additional attributes to be added into a `Person` object on top of the original AB3 attributes are encapsulated into their respective classes: `Linkedin`, `Telegram` and `Birthday`. These classes are implemented similarly to the other existing attributes of `Person`, but they are modified according to the respective input patterns that model the real world.<br>

As these attributes are additional information for a `Person` object, every attribute has been made optional in the case when user only keys in several, but not all of the additional attributes into the command. However, the purpose of using this command only exists when users would like to add additional attributes to a `Person` in the contact list. Thus, the `addalt` command is designed to ensure that the user adds at least one of the additional attributes aforementioned.

As this command merely adds additional attributes to a `Person` object, this can be done by enhancing the `add` command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate command, `addalt`.
    * Pros:
        * Many cases of empty/*null* inputs in the optional fields need not be accounted for when saving the data and testing when a new `Person` is added by the `add` command.
    * Cons:
        * Inconveniences users as users have to key in two separate commands in order to add additional attributes of a `Person`.
* **Alternative 2:** Enhance the current `add` command.
    * Pros:
        * Improves the user's convenience by allowing them to add both compulsory and optional attributes to a new `Person` entry.
    * Cons:
        * Many cases of empty/*null* inputs in the optional fields have to be accounted for when saving the data and testing.

### Edit feature

#### Implementation Details

The `edit` feature is similar to the implementation of [**`addalt`**](#addalt-feature); it involves creating a new `Person` object with edited contact details to replace the previous `Person` object.
This is done using the `EditPersonDescriptor` class; `EditPersonDescriptor` object stores the contact information to be updated to the previous `Person` object.

The `edit` command has similar input fields to the [**`addalt`**](#addalt-feature) command with the difference being that it is able to edit all the attributes of a `Person` object except:

* `Note`: The notes of the contact. Read [**`Notes feature`**](#notes-feature) for more details.
* `Avatar`: The profile picture of the contact. Read [**`Update photo feature`**](#update-photo-feature) for more details.
* `Balance`: The amount that the contact owes. Read [**`Payments feature`**](#payments-feature) for more details.

<box type="info">

While all the fields are optional, at least one needs to be given to the `edit` command. Users who wishes to `edit` empty additional attributes of `Person` object should use [`addalt`](#addalt-feature) instead.
</box>

#### Feature details
1. Similar to [`addalt`](#addalt-feature), the application will validate the arguments supplied by the user; whether the `INDEX` provided is valid and each of `Person` attribute input follows the pre-determined formats defined in their respective classes. However, it also checks that the `edit` command does not update any empty additional attributes of `Person` and update `Person` object to have same primary and secondary email.
2. If an input fails the validation check, an error message is provided which details the error and prompts the user the course of action.
3. If the input passes the validation check, the application checks if the corresponding `Person` and the new `Person` object with the edited attributes is the same.
4. If the check fails, user will be prompted that current `edit` command does not update the `Person` object.
5. Otherwise, a new `Person` objected with the updated attributes is created and stored in the `AddressBook`.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of a user using the `edit` command:

<puml src="diagrams/EditActivityDiagram.puml" alt="EditActivityDiagram" />

The flow for the `edit` command is described by the following sequence diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design Considerations
Since `edit` command updates attributes of a `Person` object, setting the values directly to the `Person` object could be another viable option.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Person` object.
    * Pros:
        * Guarantees immutability of `Person` class, reducing possible bugs.
    * Cons:
        * Performance overhead; a `Person` object is always created even if for instance, only one attribute of `Person` object is changed.
* **Alternative 2:** Set the edited attributes to the existing `Person` object.
    * Pros:
        * Minimal performance overhead; less memory usage.
    * Cons:
        * More bug prone.

### Find feature

The find command feature allows users to locate specific Person instances within the application based on keywords provided.
It is significantly revamped from AB3's implementation in three ways:

- Support for all Person fields except photos, with conditions for each field set based on the most appropriate way a user would want to search for contacts using each field (instead of just word-level matching).
- Support for boolean operators, allowing users to combine multiple search criteria into an arbitrarily-complex boolean expression.
- Support for quoted strings, which allow for the use of multi-word keywords or keywords with some special characters.

This is accomplished using a custom-built tokenizer / lexer (`FindFilterStringTokenizer`) and parser (`FindExpressionParser`).
The existing `FindCommandParser` is used as a harness to tie the two together and provide a single entry point for the feature.

---

##### Tokenizing / Lexing

The `FindFilterStringTokenizer` class is responsible for parsing complex boolean find filter strings into tokens, which can later be used to construct a filter expression tree.
It is reminiscent of lexers used in interpreters and compilers, and is implemented using a state machine.

The class also includes a `Token` inner class that represents a token in the filter string. Each `Token` has a `Type` and a text representing the token in the filter string.

The class takes a filter string as input and tokenizes it into a list of `Token` objects.
Each `Token` object represents a component in the boolean filter string and has a `Type` (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LPAREN`, `RPAREN`, `CONDITION`) and a text representing the token in the filter string.

The `tokenize` method is the main method in this class.
It iterates over the characters in the filter string and based on the current character, it creates a new `Token` object and adds it to the list of tokens.
The method handles different types of tokens including AND, OR, NOT operators, parentheses for grouping, and conditions in the form of `FIELD/KEYWORD` or `FIELD/"KEYWORDS AS QUOTED STRING"`.

Ultimately, the `tokenize` method returns a list of `Token` objects that represent the tokens in the filter string.

---

##### Parsing

The `FindExpressionParser` class is responsible for constructing a filter expression tree from a list of tokens, which is reminiscent of parsers used in interpreters and compilers.
The `parseToPredicate` method is the main method in this class.
It uses a recursive descent parsing algorithm to parse the list of tokens into a filter expression tree.
The class also converts it into a `Predicate<Person>` that can be directly used to filter the list of persons.

Specifically, the class takes a list of `Token` objects from `FindFilterStringTokenizer` and parses it into a filter expression tree.
These nodes are represented as subclasses of the `ExprNode` inner class, which is an abstract class that represents a node in the filter expression tree.
Each `ExprNode` has a `Type` and a `text` representing the node in the filter string, as well as a `toPredicate` method which outlines how to convert that node into a `Predicate<Person>` which can actually be used to filter through a person list.
The subclasses are:

- `BinaryOpNode`: Represents a binary operation (`AND`, `OR`) between two other nodes (which can be any type of ExprNode).
- `NotNode`: Represents a `NOT` operation on another node (which can be any type of ExprNode).
- `ConditionNode`: Represents a condition in the form of `FIELD/KEYWORD` or `FIELD/"KEYWORDS AS QUOTED STRING"`.


The parsing conducted by the `parseToPredicate` method follows the structure of a boolean expression grammar, which is defined as follows:

- Expression: An expression is a term or an expression followed by `OR` and a term.
- Term: A term is a factor or a term followed by `AND` and a factor.
- Factor: A factor is a condition, a factor preceded by `NOT`, or an expression enclosed in parentheses.

This structure ensures that the `AND` operator has higher precedence than the `OR` operator, and the `NOT` operator has higher precedence than both `AND` and `OR`.
This is because a term (which can contain `AND` operations) is treated as a single unit in an expression, and a factor (which can contain `NOT` operations) is treated as a single unit in a term.


Ultimately, the `parse` method returns an `ExprNode` object that represents the root of the filter expression tree.
This tree structure represents the logical structure of the user's input and is used to evaluate whether a record matches the filter conditions.

---

The flow of the find feature is described by the following high-level sequence diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command Flexibility vs. Complexity**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Support boolean operations in `FindCommand`.
  * Pros: Provides powerful search capabilities.
  * Cons: Increases code complexity and potential for user input errors.

* **Alternative 2**: Only allow simple keyword-based searches.
  * Pros: Easier to implement and use.
  * Cons: Limits user's searching abilities.


**Aspect: Tokenizer library**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Custom-built tokenizer and parser.
  * Pros: Allows for more flexibility in terms of the syntax of the search criteria. Can handle our custom-defined terms, operators, and grouping symbols explicitly.
  * Cons: More code required, requires regular maintenance to adapt to new features or changes.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a third-party library.
  * Pros: Less code required, might be more robust and have additional features.
  * Cons: Less flexibility in terms of the syntax of the search criteria. May not be able to handle our custom-defined terms, operators, and grouping symbols explicitly. Might not cater explicitly to the specific requirements of the Find command. Requires integration efforts.

**Aspect: Tokenization Strategy**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Custom tokenizer.
  * Pros: Greater control and flexibility.
  * Cons: More complex to implement and maintain.

* **Alternative 2**: Regular expression-based tokenizer.
  * Pros: Can be more concise.
  * Cons: May not handle all edge cases or complexities.


**Aspect: Supported Logical Operators**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use standard boolean operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
  * Pros: Universally recognized and understood.
  * Cons: Limited to boolean logic.

* **Alternative 2:** Support more advanced operators or functions (e.g., nearness search, regex patterns).
  * Pros: Provides more power and flexibility to users.
  * Cons: Significantly complicates parsing and understanding for users.

**Aspect: Handling Invalid Inputs**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Throw an exception and inform the user.
  * Pros: User is made aware of mistakes immediately.
  * Cons: Stops the command processing.
* **Alternative 2**: Silently ignore or correct invalid inputs.
  * Pros: Smoother user experience.
  * Cons: User might not realize they made a mistake.

### Update photo feature
#### Implementation
##### Command logic
The `UpdatePhotoCommand` feature allows users to update photo of a specific contact. This functionality is essential for forgetful users who want to store photos of contacts to remember them easier.

Two key classes are involved in this implementation:
- `UpdatePhotoCommand`: Handles the logic for updating photo.
- `Avatar`: Represents the photo of a contact.

Photos are stored as an `Avatar` within the Person model.

The `Avatar` class contains a `String` representing the path to the chosen photo.

When a user inputs a command to update photo of a contact, the `UpdatePhotoCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a new `UpdatePhotoCommand` object. This object is then executed, which results in the update of the contact's photo.


The process can be summarized in the following logic flow:
<puml src="diagrams/updatephoto-command/UpdatePhotoCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" />

1. Parse user input to create a `UpdatePhotoCommand` object.
2. Execute the `UpdatePhotoCommand`, which involves:
    - Retrieving the list of all persons.
    - Validating the provided index.
    - Creating an exact copy of the person at the provided index, except for the `Avatar`.
    - Replacing the specified person with their copy.
3. Return a `CommandResult` indicating the outcome.

Key methods in this implementation include:
- `UpdatePhotoCommand::UpdatePhotoCommand(Index index, String path)`: Constructor to initialize the command.
- `UpdatePhotoCommand::execute(Model model)`: Updates the photo as well as the model.

### Payments feature

#### Implementation

The Payments feature allows users to keep track of the money they owe to and are owed by their contacts.
This feature is useful for users who want an easy way to figure out how to settle their payments in one future transaction, and ensure that all transactions are tracked and eventually settled.

Three key classes are involved in this implementation:
- `Balance`: Represents money amounts owed by or to a contact.
- `PayCommand`: Handles the logic to track that you have paid / lent money to a contact.
- `PaybackCommand`: Handles the logic to track that you have received / borrowed money from a contact.

Additionally, the `ParserUtil::parseBalance` method is used to parse a human-friendly string representation of a balance into an `int` value representing a monetary value in cents.

Money is represented with a `Balance` class, which is effectively a wrapper around an `int` value representing a monetary value in cents. However, users interact with the `Balance` class through a human-friendly string representation, with a dollars and cents component, that may optionally include a dollar sign.

Most validation is handled by the `Balance` class, through three static methods:
- `isValidDollarString(String test)`: Checks if a given string is a valid human-friendly string representation of a balance using a validation regex.
- `isWithinBalanceLimit(Integer balanceInCents)`: Checks if a given integer is a valid balance value that is a field of a contact. CampusConnect restricts users to only be able to track a maximum payment owed to / from a contact of $10,000.
- `isWithinTransactionLimit(Integer amountInCents)`: Checks if a given integer is a valid money value that is used in a single transaction. Due to the $10,000 balance limit, any individual transaction cannot transact more than $20,000, since that will always lead to the balance limit being exceeded. This check occurs whenever a `Balance` object is instantiated, since there should never be any `Balance` objects with a value greater than $20,000.

The `PayCommand` and `OweCommand` classes are extremely similar. Both classes simply update the Person's balance with the amount given.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of the validation checks that occur when a user uses the `pay` command:

<puml src="diagrams/PayActivityDiagram.puml" alt="PayActivityDiagram" />

The series of validation checks in the activity diagram also applies to the `owe` command.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Money representation data type**

There are multiple options to represent money values in the application within the Balance class.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `int` to represent money value in cents.
  * Pros: Simple and straightforward, and not vulnerable to floating-point precision errors.
  * Cons: Requires more complex processing when converting to human-friendly string representations.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `double` to represent money value in dollars.
  * Pros: More human-friendly.
  * Cons: Vulnerable to floating-point precision errors.

**Aspect: Specialization of commands**

The payments feature could be implemented as a single command, with a negative sign to specify whether the payment is a `pay` or `owe` command.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use two separate `pay` and `owe` commands to represent positive and negative transactions.
  * Pros: Make the concept more straightforward for a human to understand; humans verbalize their thoughts by saying "I pay $X to contact Y" or "I owe $X to contact Y".
  * Cons: Requires users to remember two separate commands, and requires more code to implement and be maintained.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a single command that takes in values with negative signs.
  * Pros: Only requires users to remember a single command, and less code maintenance required by maintainers.
  * Cons: Less human-readable, and requires more complex processing to handle negative signs.

### Notes feature
#### Implementation
##### Commmand logic
The `AddNoteCommand` feature allows users to add personalized notes to a specific contact in the Address Book. This functionality is essential for users who wish to record additional information about their contacts.

Three key classes are involved in this implementation:
- `AddNoteCommand`: Handles the logic for adding the note.
- `Index`: Represents the index of the person in the filtered person list to whom the note will be added.
- `Note`: Represents the content of the note to be added.

Notes are stored as an `ObservableList<Note>` within the Person model. This is done to simplify storage and retrieval of notes, as well as to enable the use of JavaFX components to display the notes with the `Observer` pattern.

The `Note` class is a simple wrapper class that contains a `String` representing the content of the note.

When a user inputs a command to add a note, the `NoteCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a new `AddNoteCommand` object. This object is then executed, which results in the addition of the specified note to the targeted contact.


The process can be summarized in the following logic flow:
<puml src="diagrams/notes/NotesCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" />

1. Parse user input to create a `AddNoteCommand` object.
2. Execute the `AddNoteCommand`, which involves:
    - Retrieving the list of all persons.
    - Validating the provided index.
    - Adding the note to the person at the specified index.
3. Return a `CommandResult` indicating the outcome.

Key methods in this implementation include:
- `AddNoteCommand(Index index, Note note)`: Constructor to initialize the command.
- `execute(Model model)`: Adds the note and updates the model.




##### UI Logic
The Notes feature also includes a user interface component to allow users to interactively add, view, and remove notes from contacts.

The user interface for the Notes feature is implemented using JavaFX components. The main components include:
- `PersonCard`: Displays individual person's details and includes a button for accessing notes.
- `NotesWindow`: A pop-up window that displays all notes associated with a person.

The `PersonCard` component includes a button (`notesButton`) that, when clicked, triggers the `handleNotesButtonClick` method in the controller. This method creates and shows a new `NotesWindow`.

The `NotesWindow` is responsible for displaying the list of notes and is populated using a `ListView` component. The controller for `NotesWindow` handles the population of this list and the closing of the window. `NotesWindow` has a button (`closeButton`) that, when clicked, triggers the `handleCloseButtonClick` method in the controller. This method closes the window. The `NotesWindow` is also closed when the user presses the `ESC` key.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Integration with Existing Data Model**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Leverage existing `Person` class and `Model` interface.
    * Pros: Utilizes existing data structures and methods, ensuring consistency and potentially reducing the likelihood of bugs.
    * Cons: The `Person` class becomes more complex as more features are added.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a separate system for managing notes.
    * Pros: Keeps the `Person` class simpler and more focused on contact information.
    * Cons: May result in duplication of effort and increased complexity in ensuring consistency between the contact and note systems.

Choosing alternative 1 aligns with the principle of maximizing code reuse and maintaining consistency across the application, even though it slightly increases the complexity of the `Person` class.

**Aspect: User Interaction and Experience**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pop-up window for notes.
    * Pros: Provides a clear and focused view for user to manage notes.
    * Cons: Additional window management required; may be less convenient for quick interactions.
* **Alternative 2:** Inline editing within the `PersonCard`.
    * Pros: Potentially more convenient for quick additions or edits.
    * Cons: Could clutter the interface and distract from the main contact information.

Choosing alternative 1 provides a balance between functionality and user interface simplicity, ensuring that the notes feature does not overwhelm the main contact viewing experience.

#### Testing

The UI components are tested using TestFX to ensure that they behave as expected. Test cases include verifying the display of notes, interaction responses, and the proper functioning of the close button. Ensuring thorough testing is vital for maintaining the reliability and user-friendliness of the application.

Take note that UI tests have to be run on the `JavaFX` thread, so UI tests have to extend `ApplicationTest` from `TestFX` to run properly.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements / Known Issues**

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When executing `add`/`edit` command**, if you try to add/edit a new/existing contact with the same [properties](#properties-of-contact) of another saved contact **(Note: 2 names are considered the same if both of them have the same casing and whitespaces)** in your contact list, CampusConnect allows you to do so. We plan to enhance the `add`/`edit` command such that it **takes into account what makes a contact unique in your contact list.**
3. **When executing `addalt` command**, if you input other prefixes that are not accepted by the command format, the error message shown does not prompt you to remove those prefixes and adhere strictly to the command format. We will be working on this in the future to **improve the specificity of error messages.**
4. **When executing commands with `PERSON_INDEX`**, if you did not input an appropriate index, the error message shown is generic; CampusConnect informs you the format of the command you should adhere to instead of prompting you to input a positive index. We will be working on this in the future to **improve the specificity of error messages.**
5. **When executing `updatephoto` command**, if the `PERSON_INDEX` contains characters besides `0-9`, CampusConnect will be unresponsive as we assume that you will input a valid integer for `PERSON_INDEX`. Moreover, successful execution of the same `updatephoto` command with the same image will still result in `Photo updated` even though the photo is not updated. In addition, you can input multiple valid paths and the command will update your contact profile with the last image. We will be working on **handling more errors and improving the specificity of messages in the future.**
6. **When executing all commands**, CampusConnect only accepts printable ASCII characters. Additionally, certain commands may only accept alphanumeric input (such as name field in `add` not accepting slashes). We plan to improve our internationalization support in the future, allowing for Unicode characters to be used throughout the app since users could have contacts with names including diacritics or non-alphabetic characters (e.g. Tamil, Arabic or Chinese names).
7. **When executing the `find` command**, if you input a `FIND_EXPRESSION` that is not accepted by the command format, the error message shows fairly general error messages. We will be working on this in the future to **improve the specificity of error messages.**
8. **When executing the `find` command**, it is impossible to search for keywords that include the double-quote character (`"`) under any circumstance. We will be working on this in the future to **support searching for the double-quote character**, which could appear in fields such as notes.
9. **When executing the `find` command**, the behavior of the `bal` field is not intuitive, especially for users who do not read the User Guide in-depth. We will be working on this in the future to **improve the ergonomics of `bal` field**, by implementing `>` and `<` operators so users can search for balance amounts below or above the keywords.
10. **When starting the app**, if data that is previously stored in `addressbook.json` is unable to be parsed by the application as a valid `AddressBook` (e.g. data is corrupt), the app may overwrite it on the next exit, causing data loss. We will rewrite our data storage code to be more robust when dealing with this issue by backing up data files even when they are corrupt, allowing users to retrieve them in the future.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Adding a person

1. Adding a `Person`:

    1. **Test case:** `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@gmail.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`<br>
       **Expected:** A new `Person` is successfully created with name "John Doe", phone "98765432", email "johndoe@gmail.com" and address "John street, block 123, #01-01". Success details shown in the status message. Moreover, this new `Person` is visible in CampusConnect.

    2. **Test case:** `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@gmail.com a/`<br>
       **Expected:** No new `Person` is created. Error details shown in the status message.
   
   3. **Test case:** `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@gmail.com`<br>
      **Expected:** No new `Person` is created. Error details shown in the status message. 
   
2. To see if the `Person` is added, use the `list` command and verify the last `Person` in CampusConnect.

### Adding alternative contact to a person

1. Adding alternative contact to a `Person`:

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
CampusConnect is an advanced extension of the foundational AB3, enriched with sophisticated new features and a more advanced UI. These enhancements are complex and significantly expand the application's functionality beyond the original AB3.

### Challenges faced
Our project encountered numerous challenges:

#### Extending Base AB3 Functionality
- **Understanding AB3's Structure**: Implementing features like **addalt** necessitated a deep dive into the AB3 codebase to modify classes such as `Person.java`. AB3's extensive codebase posed a significant learning curve.
- **Mastering JavaFX**: Enhancements like adding tags to denote fields required us to learn JavaFX and CSS, technologies that were new to us.

#### Adding New Functionality to AB3
- **Notification System**: We developed a comprehensive notification system for event reminders, integrating it with the existing AB3 architecture.
- **Profile Photo Feature**: Introducing profile photos meant having to figure out what was the best way to deal with user data that was not text-based and unable to be stored within the already existing `addressbook.json`.
- **Notes Feature**: Implementing the notes feature involved creating new UI interface elements such as `NotesWindow.java`, as well as figuring out how to modify already-existing UI elements like `PersonCard.java`.
- **Payments Feature**: The development of the payments system required us to modify large portions of pre-existing code. Additionally, the various risk-control checks to ensure the system was robust and secure were challenging to implement.
- **Search Functionality Expansion**: The `find` function was enhanced to support complex, fully expressive queries. This involved developing a custom tokenizer, parser and expression evaluator, which was a significant undertaking.
- **Testing Coverage Expansion with TestFX**: Expanding testing coverage to include UI testing required the use of TestFX, which was a new framework that we had to pick up and learn.

### Achievements
- **UI Enhancements**: The UI of CampusConnect has been improved beyond the AB3 baseline, improving user experience. For instance, fields are now demarcated with a tag, and the application now supports profile photos.
- **New Systems**: The application now features a range of new systems, including a generalized notification system and a payment tracking system. This added a lot of functionality which the base AB3 lacked, and which was useful for users of CampusConnect.
- **Functionality Expansion**: Numerous features of the base AB3 have been extended, resulting in a richer contact book application which is able to store more information about contacts such as their Telegram, secondary email and LinkedIn profiles.
- **Search Capabilities Enhancement**: The search functionality has been augmented to accommodate complex, fully expressive searches. This greatly improves the user experience as it allows users to quickly find the contacts they are looking for.
- **Test Coverage**: We maintained rigorous test coverage throughout our development process, only allowing PRs to be merged if they demonstrated sufficient test coverage. Additionally, we expanded our testing methodology to include UI testing, which was not present in the base AB3.

### Efficiency through Reuse
- **Extending AB3 Classes**: We extended the `Person` class to incorporate additional data fields crucial for the `addalt` feature.
- **DateTime Libraries**: We utilized existing DateTime libraries for efficient and correct parsing of time-related data, which improved our development speed as it meant we did not have to write our own date-time parsing code.

Overall, significant effort was spent in firstly evaluating our user requirements, and then coming up with ways in which we could extend AB3 to better suit their needs. The implementation of these features often required us to extend AB3 well beyond its original capabilities, and in some cases write entirely new systems in order to support them. Development work was carried out without sacrificing code quality, and we maintained a high standard of testing throughout the process, only merging PRs if they demonstrated sufficient test coverage.
