### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" style="margin-left:230px"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteMember 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="800px" style="margin-left:-30px; max-width:1000px"/>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300px" style="margin-left:220px"/>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1000px" style="margin-left:-130px; max-width:1000px" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemberListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, (but excluding `Stylesheet`) inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Member` and `Event` objects residing in the Model

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550px" style="margin-left:95px"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteMember 1")` API call as an example.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" style="max-width:1200px; margin-left:-230px" width="1200px">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteMemberCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `CCACommanderParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteMemberCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteMemberCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a member).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600px" style="margin-left:70px"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CcaCommanderParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateMemberCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateMemberCommand`) which the `CcaCommanderParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateMemberCommandParser`, `DeleteMemberCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/model/Model.java)
* The class diagram below gives an overview of the model package.<br/>
*Details of the `Member`, `Event`, and `Enrolment` packages have be omitted for brevity.
Please refer to the [Member](#member-model), [Event](#event-model) and [Enrolment](#enrolment-model) diagrams for more information.*

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="740px" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the CCACommander data i.e., all `Member` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMemberList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Member` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores `Event` and `Enrolment` objects in a similar way to the `Member` objects.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="740px"/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CCACommander data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `CcaCommanderStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ccacommander.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Member Model
This section explains how the `Member` model is implemented and the various design consideration when
implementing this model.

The class diagram below shows the current implementation of `Member` model.

<img src="images/MemberClassDiagram.png" width="500px" style="margin-left:120px">

Every `Member` contains a `Name`, `Gender`, `Optional<Phone>`, `Optional<Email>`, `Optional<Address>`, `Optional<Hours>`, `Optional<Remark>` and a set of `Tags`. `UniqueMemberList` stores all unique instances of `Member`.

Note that the `Hours` and a `Remark` fields will only be meaningfully initialised
when either `viewMember` or `viewEvent` command is called. Hence, these two fields are only tools for UI related purposes.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

This section elaborates further on why we chose to adopt a `Name` over other potential
solutions.

**Aspect: How to uniquely identify Members across models.**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ensure that each `Member` must have a unique `Name`
    * Pros:
        * This is convenient to implement as each `Member` entity will have a `Name` field attached to it.
        * Using a name is intuitive for users, as individuals are typically identified by their names.
        * This approach simplifies user interaction and search functionality, as names are commonly used identifiers.
        * Overall, names are easier to manage and communicate compared to complex alphanumeric identifiers.
    * Cons:
        * Limits scalability, as the pool of available names may be finite.
        * Prone to errors if there is insufficient validation, leading to the possibility of duplicate names.
        * Susceptible to changes in personal information, such as name modifications, requiring additional handling for related entities such as `Enrolment`.

* **Alternative 2 :**  Introduce a `UUID` attribute for each `Member`.
    * Pros:
        * `UUID` is immutable.
    * Cons:
        * The implementation process is intricate, requiring careful integration of the UUID field into the `Member` model and the establishment of 
          equality checks in CCACommander based on UUID.
        * There exists a potential risk of `UUID` collisions when dealing with substantial amounts of member data 
          generated by random `UUID` generation. More so when `Event` would also use `UUID` if we integrate `UUID` in `Member`.

          
### Event Model
This section explains how the `Event` model is implemented and the various design consideration when
implementing this model.

The `Event` and `UniqueEventList` classes are implemented as shown in the diagram below:

<img src="images/EventClassDiagram.png" width="500px" style="margin-left:120px">

Every `Event` contains a `Name`, `Location`, `EventDate`, `Optional<Hours>`, `Optional<Remark>` and a set of `Tags`.
`UniqueEventList` stores all unique instances of `Event`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Note that similar to `Member` class , the `Hours` and a `Remark` fields will only be meaningfully initialised
when either `viewMember` or `viewEvent` command is called. Hence, these two fields are only tools for UI related purposes.


#### Design Considerations

This section elaborates further on why we chose to adopt a `Name` over other potential
solutions.
 
**Aspect: How to uniquely identify Events across models.**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ensure that each `Event` must have a unique `Name`
    * Pros:
        * This is convenient to implement as each `Event` entity will have a `Name` field attached to it.
        * This approach will ensure consistency with the Member class by both utilizing Name as the identifier.
        * This approach simplifies user interaction and search functionality, as names are commonly used identifiers.
        * Overall, names are easier to manage and communicate compared to complex alphanumeric identifiers.
    * Cons:
        * Limits scalability, as the pool of available names may be finite.
        * Prone to errors if there is insufficient validation, leading to the possibility of duplicate names.
        * Susceptible to changes in personal information, such as name modifications, requiring additional handling for related entities such as `Enrolment`.

* **Alternative 2 :**  Introduce a `UUID` attribute for each `Event`.
    * Pros:
        * `UUID` is immutable.
    * Cons:
        * The implementation process is intricate, requiring careful integration of the UUID field into the `Event` model and the establishment of
          equality checks in CCACommander based on UUID.
        * There exists a potential risk of `UUID` collisions when dealing with substantial amounts of event data
          generated by random `UUID` generation. 

### Enrolment Model
This section explains how the `Enrolment` model is implemented and the various design consideration when
implementing this model.

#### Implementation
The `Enrolment` and `UniqueEnrolmentList` classes are implemented as shown in the diagram below:

<img src="images/EnrolmentClassDiagram.png" style="margin-left:223px">

`Enrolment` encapsulates the enrolment of a member into an event. It composes of the `Name` of the member and
the `Name` of the event enrolled in, number of `Hours` they contributed, and a `Remark` to note for that
enrolment. `UniqueEnrolmentList` stores all unique instances of `Enrolment`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store each member's events and each event's members.**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the enrolments as an independent list.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
    * Less performance issues when loading and storing enrolments.
  * Cons:
    * Incur high performance cost when viewing members of event or events of member.

* **Alternative 2:** Each member or event has its own list of enrolments.
  * Pros:
    * Linear time to view members of event or events of members.
  * Cons:
    * Hard to implement.
    * Will encounter more difficulties when implementing other features related to enrolment.

Alternative 1 was chosen as the benefit of having a simple design outweighs the cost of having a higher
performance overhead when viewing members of event or events of member. Alternative 2 has multiple layers of
complexities that are difficult to navigate and this will compound when dealing with other features related to
enrolment. The simpler design of alternative 1 also allows for more rigorous testing.

### Enrol Feature
The enrol feature allows users to link a member to an event in order to keep track of their enrolment and contributions to the event.

This section will explain how the enrol feature was implemented and the various design considerations when implementing the feature.

#### Implementation
The enrolment mechanism is facilitated by `EnrolCommand`. It extends `Command`.
The method, `EnrolCommand#execute(Model model)`, performs a validity check and adds a member's enrolment for a particular event if
all the supplied parameters are valid.

The sequence diagram below shows how the `Model` and `LogicManager` components interact when a `EnrolCommand` is executed with user input
`enrol m/1 e/1 h/1 r/Role: Photographer` represented by `...`

<img src="images/EnrolSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000px" style="max-width: 1000px; margin-left:-130px"/>

1. `LogicManager` uses the `CcaCommanderParser` class to parse the user command, creating a new instance of `EnrolCommandParser` object.
2. The `EnrolCommandParser` creates a new instance of a `EnrolCommand` object and returns it to `CcaCommanderParser`
1. `CcaCommanderParser` encapsulates the `EnrolCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by
   the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution calls `Model#getFilteredMemberList()` and `Model#getFilteredEventList()` to get the desired `member` and
   `event` respectively using indexes supplied by the user.
1. Next, the command execution creates a new instance of an `Enrolment` object.
1. `Model#createEnrolment()` is then called, adding the new `Enrolment` object to the `uniqueEnrolmentList` object in `model`.
1. The change resulting from the command's execution is saved using the `Model#commit(String commitMessage)` method for the `undo`/`redo` feature.
1. A `CommandResult` object which encapsulates the result of the command execution is passed back to the `Ui`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following activity diagram shows how the `EnrolCommand` works.

<img src="images/EnrolActivityDiagram.png" width="860px" style="max-width: 860px; margin-left:-120px"/>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: `EnrolCommand` parameters**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `EnrolCommand` has parameters `Name memberName`, `Name eventName`, `Hours hours` and `Remark remark`.
    * Pros:
        * Less complex code reduces the possibility of bugs.
        * Reduced coupling, enhancing maintainability
    * Cons:
        * Not standardised with other creation commands.

* **Alternative 2:** `EnrolCommand` has parameter `Enrolment enrolment`
    * Pros:
        * Standardised with other creation commands
    * Cons:
        * More complex code leading to higher possibility of bugs.
        * Increased coupling, reducing maintainability.

Alternative 1 was chosen because the cons of implementing alternative 2 outweighs the benefits derived from it. Alternative 2
would require `EnrolCommandParser` to have knowledge of the `Model`. This would result in an increased coupling as it would
then have greater dependence on more modules. Hence, while Alternative 1 would result in the `EnrolCommand` to be not standardised
with other create commands, it provides a simpler implementation with fewer changes needed while also maintaining ease of testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Undo/Redo Feature

The Undo/Redo feature allows the user to revert commands that were entered wrongly.

This section will explain how the redo and undo features were implemented and the various design considerations when implementing the feature.

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCcaCommander`. It extends `CcaCommander` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ccaCommanderVersionList` and `versionPointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCcaCommander#commit(String commitMessage)`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current CCACommander version and its commit message in its history.
* `VersionedCcaCommander#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous CCACommander version from its history.
* `VersionedCcaCommander#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone CCACommander version from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCcaCommander` will be initialized with the initial CCACommander version, and the `versionPointer` pointing to that single CCACommander version. This initial CCACommander version will be saved into the `ccaCommanderVersionList`

<img src="images/UndoRedoVersion0.png" style="margin-left:98px"/>

Step 2. The user executes `deleteMember 5` command to delete the 5th member in CCACommander. The `deleteMember` command calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, causing the modified version of the CCACommander after the `deleteMember 5` command executes to be saved in the `ccaCommanderVersionList`, and the `versionPointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CCACommander version.

<img src="images/UndoRedoVersion1.png" style="margin-left:98px"/>

Step 3. The user executes `createMember n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new member. The `createMember` command also calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, causing another modified CCACommander version to be saved into the `ccaCommanderVersionList`.

<img src="images/UndoRedoVersion2.png" style="margin-left:98px"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, so the CCACommander version will not be saved into the `ccaCommanderVersionList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the member was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `versionPointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CCACommander version, and restores the CCACommander to that version.

<img src="images/UndoRedoVersion3.png" style="margin-left:98px"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `versionPointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CcaCommander version, then there are no previous CcaCommander versions to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000px" style="max-width:1000px; margin-left:-130px"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `versionPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone version, and restores CCACommander to that version.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `versionPointer` is at index `ccaCommanderVersionList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CCACommander version, then there are no undone CcaCommander versions to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CCACommander, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `ccaCommanderVersionList` remains unchanged.

<img src="images/UndoRedoVersion4.png" style="margin-left:98px"/>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`. Since the `versionPointer` is not pointing at the end of the `ccaCommanderVersionList`, all CCACommander versions after the `versionPointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `createMember n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<img src="images/UndoRedoVersion5.png" style="margin-left:98px"/>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" style="margin-left:241px"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CCACommander.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteMember`, just save the member being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### Command History

#### Implementation
The proposed commandHistory mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory`. It contains `commandHistoryList` and `currentCommandPointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `CommandHistory#hasPreviousCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns if there is a previously command from the history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#hasNextCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns if there is a next command from the history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous command from its history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the next command from its history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#addCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Add the command into the history.
* `CommandHistory#isLastCommandEqualCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns if the command is equal to the last command added into the `commandHistoryList`.
* `CommandHistory#resetPointer()`â€‰â€”â€‰Resets the pointer to be start from the most recent command again.
* `CommandHistory#isLastCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns if `currentCommandPointer` is at the last command.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the commandHistory behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time and enters their first command.
The `CommandHistory` will save the command and the `currentCommandPointer` won't be pointing to any command.

<img src="images/CommandHistoryState0.png" style="margin-left:133px"/>

Step 2. The user presses <kbd>â†‘</kbd> while the commandBox is selected. `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()` is called and the previous command is displayed in the commandBox.
When the previous command is entered into the commandBox, the new version of command will not be stored in `CommandHistory` after calling `CommandHistory#isLastCommandEqualCommand()`
and it returns true.


<img src="images/CommandHistoryState1.png" width="960px" style="max-width:960px; margin-left:-110px"/>

Step 3. The user presses <kbd>â†‘</kbd> while the commandBox is selected. `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()` is called
and the previous command is displayed in the commandBox. When the previous command is edited and is entered into the commandBox, the newly edited version of command will be stored in `CommandHistory` after calling `CommandHistory#addCommand()`.

<img src="images/CommandHistoryState2.png" width="960px" style="max-width:960px; margin-left:-110px"/>

Step 4. The user has pressed <kbd>â†‘</kbd> while selecting the commandBox until the first Command and `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()`
is called multiple times. The user then presses <kbd>â†“</kbd> and `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()` is called and the command1 (the next command) will then be displayed in the commandBox.

<img src="images/CommandHistoryState3.png" width="960px" style="max-width:960px; margin-left:-110px"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentCommandPointer` is at
index 0, pointing to the initial first command, then there are no previous commands to restore. The program uses
`CommandHistory#hasPreviousCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will not change anything.

</div>


The opposite occurs too when calling the next command â€‰â€”â€‰ the program calls `CommandHistory#hasNextCommand()`, which shifts the `currentCommandPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously entered command and displaying that command instead.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `commandHistoryPointer` is at index `commandHistoryList.size() - 1`, pointing to nothing, then there are no commands to restore.
The program uses `CommandHistory#hasNextCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will not call `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()`
but will instead use `CommandHistory#isLastCommand()` to check if the `commandHistoryPointer` is at the last command and set the commandBox to be blank.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens to CommandHistory when a user enters a key in the commandBox:

**Aspect: Storing of Command History:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the list of all commands.
    * Pros: Allows user to iterate through all commands listed.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage after prolonged usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Command History only stores previous command.
    * Pros: Will use less memory and reduces user error.
    * Cons: Quite limited as a feature.

## **Planned Enhancements**

### Allow users to add / delete tags without retyping previous tags
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Each member/event can have tags attached to it and these tags can be edited using the `editMember`/`editEvent`
commands. However, upon adding a new tag to a member/event without typing all the old tags, it will override the initial tags attached to
the member/event and only the new tag will be displayed. This brings inconvenience to the user as the user has to
type both the old and new tags instead of just typing the new tag.
* **Example:** We have a member called Alice with a member index of 1, and she has an initial tag called `friend`. We want to
add a new tag `early` to her. Upon entering the command `editMember 1 t/early`, the current implementation will override
all the initial tags and only the `early` tag will be displayed.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to enhance the `editMember`/`editEvent` commands to give the user the flexibility to choose one of the following options
when editing the tags of the member/event:
1. Override the initial tags entirely where the new tags that the user enters will entirely replace all the old tags
2. Add new tag to the list of old tags where the old tags will remain attached to the member/event with the addition of the new tags
3. Edit current list of tags attached to the member/event
4. Delete specific tags from the current list of tags attached to the member/event

### Allow users to create and edit a member/event with name containing non-alphanumeric characters
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Member/event name only accepts alphanumeric characters and restricts the user from entering special characters
into the member/event name, which should be allowed as member/event names can contain special characters.
* **Example:** The user wants to create a new event named "Raffles Hall's Musical Production" and the user enters
`createEvent n/Raffles Hall's Musical Production l/Raffles Hall d/2023-09-19` but the message "Names should only contain
alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank" is shown to the user instead of accepting it as a valid event. This is
due to the presence of the special character `'` in the event name.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to allow the `createMember`, `editMember` , `createEvent` and `editEvent` commands to accept special
characters in the name field and not to be restricted to just alphanumeric characters.

### Allow users to delete values from optional fields in member/event/enrolment
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Currently, there is no way for the user to delete unwanted values for optional fields in member/event/enrolment.
* **Example:** For example, if the user accidentally adds a remark to an enrolment, they are unable to remove it. The only way
for the user to remove this unwanted remark is to delete the enrolment and add it again without the remark, which is highly
inconvenient. This would be similar for the other optional fields in member and event.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to enhance the `editMember`, `editEvent` and `editEnrolment` commands to give the user the flexibility to remove
any unwanted values from the optional fields in member/event/enrolment. For instance, to remove the value from an optional field,
the user can provide an empty prefix e.g. if the user wishes to remove the phone number from the first member, they can do `editMember 1 p/`.

### Make UI stay on current view upon editMember or editEvent
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Currently, calling `editMember` or `editEvent` will result in the listing of all events and members.
* **Example:** If the user is viewing a filtered list for example if they have just called `viewMember`, if the user
  then edits a member or event using `editMember` or `editEvent`, all events and members will be displayed instead of their current
filtered view. This will cause inconvenience for the user as they will have to relocate the edited member/event.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to change the behaviour of `editMember` and `editEvent` such that calling them will no longer list all members and events,
and instead remain on the user's current view.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Show a more specific error message for negative index in `editMember`, `editEvent`, `viewMember`, `viewEvent`, `deleteMember` and `deleteEvent`
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** When the user inputs a negative index for the `editMember`, `editEvent`, `viewMember`, `viewEvent`,
`deleteMember` or `deleteEvent` commands, the displayed error message is not specific enough and does not make it clear
to the user that he/she has wrongly input a negative index.
* **Example:** The user enters the command `editMember -1 n/Jane Smith` and the error message displayed is
"Invalid command format!... Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer)...". The current error message fails to
highlight to the user the root cause of the error, which is a negative member index.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to make `editMember`, `editEvent`, `viewMember`, `viewEvent`, `deleteMember` and `deleteEvent` commands 
display a more specific error message along the lines of "The provided index is negative and should be a positive integer
instead." when the user inputs a negative index. In order to implement this, the relevant `CommandParser` classes have
to recognise negative indexes and throw more specific exceptions.

### Provide more specific index error messages to the user
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** As of now, for commands that accept more than 1 index as a parameter, it is hard to tell which index is wrong
based on the index error message shown to the user if one of the indexes provided is wrong. This can hamper the user's efficiency as the
user cannot tell immediately which provided index is wrong.
* **Example:** Commands such as `enrol` accept more than 1 index as a parameter. When the user accidentally enters an invalid index
such as `enrol m/1 e/-1` where the event index is wrong, the error message displayed to the user is just "Index is not a non-zero unsigned integer."
There is a lack of information shown to the user which specific index is wrong.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to make the index error messages more specific and highlight to the user which index is wrong and why
that index is wrong. For example, in the `enrol m/1 e/-1` input, we will show an error message to the user along
the lines of "The provided Event Index is not a non-zero unsigned integer."

### Improve `findMember`/`findEvent` criteria
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** As of now, `findMember` and `findEvent` commands will only match the respective member and event if
the name of the member or event contains a word that matches exactly the entire given find keyword. This means that the user will
have to remember the entire name of the `Member` or `Event` to find it, reducing the effectiveness of `findMember` and `findEvent`.
* **Example:** `findMember alex` will list a member with name "Alex Yeoh", but `findMember ale` will result in no member being
listed.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose that the find criteria will be improved such that it will find any event/member name which contains the given keyword string,
i.e. member/event name will not have to contain a word that matches exactly with the given find keyword. For example,
the command `findMember a` will now match members with name "Alex", "Alice", etc. In addition, if the user remembers that
an event name consists of 2 words, they can do `findEvent  â€Ž`, which would list all events which have a blank space in
their name.

### Make UI stay on current view upon undo/redo
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Currently, the `undo` and `redo` commands will always result in all members and events being listed.
* **Example:** For example, if the user enrols a member to an event and views the member, before deciding to unenrol the member
from the event by executing the `undo` command, all the members and events would then be listed. This inconveniences the user
as they will then have to execute the `viewMember` command again to see their changes. 

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to change the behaviour of `undo` and `redo` such that executing them will no longer list all members and events,
and instead remain on the user's current view.

### Provide specific error messages for unknown prefixes
**Current Implementation:**
* **Current Issue:** Many of the commands require the use of prefixes in the input, such as `n/`, `g/`, `p/`, etc.
However, upon inputting an erroneous unknown prefix in the command input, the error message shown to the user is not accurate.
The error message displayed will be based on the error message of the preceding prefix.
* **Example**: The user inputs the command `createMember n/Jane Smith g/Female q/test` but the error message displayed
will not highlight that the unknown `q/` prefix was typed in. The error message displayed to the user will be "Gender 
should only be one of the following: Male, Female, or Others" which is based off the standard error message
for gender prefixes, which happens to be the prefix preceding the `q/` prefix.

**Proposed Solution:**

We propose to display a more specific error message to the users if they input unknown prefixes. For example, if the user 
provides the command, `createMember n/Jane Smith g/Female q/test`, an error message along the lines of "The 
q/ prefix is not a correct prefix for this command." will be displayed. This will involve us improving the relevant 
`CommandParser` classes to properly sieve out cases of unknown prefixes being entered and throwing more
specific exceptions related to such issues.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

### Challenges
* Hard-to-fix bug where UI did not update upon data change 
* Implementation of `viewMember` / `viewEvent`
* Design of `Enrolment` class

### Effort Required and Difficulty:
* 3 entity types compared to AB3â€™s 1 entity type
* 5 new data type (Date, Gender, Location, Remark, Hours)
* 11 new commands (AB3 only had 8 commands of which 4 we updated - not included in the 11)
* Updated most data types to be optional
* Added a class (Enrolment) to relate 2 classes (Member & Event) - new feature not in AB3
* Updated UI to accommodate to members and events - 2 list panels compared to 1 in AB3
* Added new command history feature which allows users to recall commands similar to a terminal
* Added new theme-switching feature 

### Achievements:
* Added user-friendly features:
    * Command History
    * Undo/Redo
* Added personalisation feature:
    * Theme switching
* Related 2 classes together using the `Enrolment` class
* Updated UI to display all required information
