## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`,
`GradedComponentListPanel`, `StudentScoreListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `GradedComponent` and `StudentScore`objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteStu 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ModuLightParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

**Note:** There are three different model objects, namely the StudentBook, the StudentScoreBook and the GradedComponentBook.
The command might interact with one or more model objects. For example, when a student is deleted, the command will communicate 
with the StudentBook to delete this student, as well as the StudentScoreBook, to delete all the student scores relevant to this student.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModuLightParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ModuLightParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

Note that Student, StudentGrade and GradeComponent classes have similar structures and dependencies, thus, we use Ssc class to represent these three and their related classes in the class diagram above.

Here are the class diagrams for Ssc (Student, StudentGrade, GradedComponent) classes respectively.
<puml src="diagrams/StudentModelDiagram.puml" width="450" /> <br>
<puml src="diagrams/StudentScoreModelDiagram.puml" width="300" />
<puml src="diagrams/GradedComponentModelDiagram.puml" width="300" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the ModuLight data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), all `StudentScore` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentScoreList` object) and all `GradedComponent` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGradedComponentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student`, `StudentScore` and `GradedComponent` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists respectively which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`, `ObservableList<StudentScore>` and `ObservableList<GradedComponent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** For student and student score, an alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Student`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />

Here are the complete class diagrams of StudentBook Storage, StudentScoreBook Storage and GradedComponentBook Storage.

<puml src="diagrams/StudentAndScoreBookStorage.puml" />


<puml src="diagrams/GradedComponentBookStorage.puml" />


The `Storage` component,
* can save student data, student score data, graded component data and user preference data in JSON format, and read 
  them back into the corresponding objects.  
* inherits from `StudentBookStorage`, `GradedComponentBookStorage`, `StudentScoreBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as any of the one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.modulight.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student
The `addStu` function allows the user to add a new student to the database. ModuLight maintains a `UniqueStudentList` 
to make sure that there is no duplicates. 

A  typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to create a new student. The student can only be added if the user entered valid inputs for its name, student id, email, tutorial group(optional) and tag(optional). If the inputs are invalid or if there are required flags missing, a `ParseException` is thrown and error message will be displayed.
2. Otherwise, a new `Student` object with the given inputs is created. A default `TutorialGroup` with value `T00` will be assigned to the student if the user did not assign the student to a tutorial group.
3. The new `Student` object will be added to the `StudentBook`. If the student already exists in the student book, a `CommandException` is thrown and error message will be displayed
4. If there exists `GradedComponent` in the model. An empty `StudentScore` related to this `Student` will be added to all existing `GradedComponent`. This score will be stored in the `Student` entity as well.
5. Acknowledgement message is displayed.


The following activity diagram illustrates the process of execution of an `AddStudentCommand`.
![AddStudentCommand](diagrams/AddStudent.png)

### Edit Student
The `editStu` function allows the user to edit the information of the student indicated by index. 
The previous `Student` object will be removed from the `StudentBook`. A new student object with the edited information will be added to the database. 
All student scores related to this `Student` will be updated as well.

A  typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to edit a student. The student can only be edited if the user entered valid index and inputs for its name, student id, email, tutorial group(optional) and tag(optional). If the index or inputs are invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown and error message will be displayed.
2. Otherwise, a new edited `Student` object with the given inputs is created. 
3. The new `Student` object will be added to the `StudentBook` to replace the previous one. If the student already exists in the student book(e.g. the edited `StudentId already exists`), a `CommandException` is thrown and error message will be displayed
4. The linkage between the edited student and its scores will be updated. The linkage between the scores and their components will be updated as well.
5. Acknowledgement message is displayed.

The following activity diagram illustrates the process of execution of an `EditStudentCommand`.
![AddStudentCommand](diagrams/EditStudent.png)

### Find Commands
The find commands allows users to find the student, student scores and graded components that they are interested in.
We have three find commands in total: `findStu`, `findScore` and `findComp`. The implementation of these three commands are similar. Here we use the `findStu` command to illustrate how they are executed.

#### Find Student
The `findStu` function allows the user to find the student that matches the given search criteria.

It displays both the matching students and relevant student scores that belongs to the student.
All graded components are displayed since they are considered relevant to the student.

To find the wanted student, a `StudentMatchPredicate` is created to test whether a student matches the search keywords. A `ScoreMatchPredicate` is created from the `StudentMatchPredicate` to test whether the score belongs to the matched student.
This only changes the displayed list of students and student scores, stored as `filteredStudentList` and `filteredStudentScoreList` in `Model`, without affecting the data stored in ModuLight.

A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to find students, e.g. `findStu g/t01`
2. `FindStudentCommandParser` attempts to parses the flags present, in this case only `g/`. Note that `FindStudentCommandParser` does not check for invalid inputs, as
user might use partial keywords to perform the search.
3. If the parse is successful, a `StudentMatchPredicate` is created to find the students from tutorial groups that matches `t01`. A `ScoreMatchPredicate` os created by passing this `StudentMatchPredicate` to find the scores that belong to these students.
4. A new `FindStudentCommand` is created from these predicates and passed back to `LogicManager`.
5. The command is executed. The `filteredStudentList` and `filteredStudentScoreList` are updated with the predicates passed in to the command. The diagram omits an extra action to show all components in `filteredGradedComponentList`.
6. The command result is created and passed back to the `LogicManager`.



The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of execution of an `FindStudentCommand`.

![AddStudentCommand](diagrams/FindStudent.png)

### List Commands
The `listAll` command lists all student, student scores and graded components in ModuLight. This is often used after filtering the displayed lists with the find commands.<br>

A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a `listAll` command to list all entities
2. ModuLight updates the  `filteredStudentList` with a pre-determined `StudentMatchPredicate` that returns true for all students.
3. ModuLight updates the  `filteredStudentScoreList` with a pre-determined `ScoreMatchPredicate` that returns true for all scores.
4. ModuLight updates the  `filteredGradedComponentList` with a pre-determined `GcMatchPredicate` that returns true for all components.
5. ModuLight displays all students, student scores, graded components and a acknowledgement message.

Below is an activity diagram that demonstrates how this command works.

![listAllCommand](diagrams/List.png)

### Add Graded Component

<puml src="diagrams/AddGradedComponentSequenceDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

The `addComp` command allows users to add a graded component and automaticaly create student scores associated with that component for every student in the database.
A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to add a graded component, for instance `addComp 1 c/Midterms w/30 mm/60`.
2. `AddGradedComponentCommandParser` attempts to parse the flags `c/`, `mm/` and `w/` which represent the
   component name, maximum mark and weightage values respectively. It performs several checks, failing which a `ParseCommandException` is thrown:
    1. All 3 flags have non-empty values.
    2. The component name, maximum marks and weightage values provided are valid. (eg. `Weightage` is a number between 0 and 100)
    3. There are no duplicate flags provided.
3. Assuming all flag values have been successfully parsed, these are used to initialize a `GradedComponent` which is passed into `AddGradedComponentCommand`.
4. Within `AddGradedComponentCommand`, a second round of checks is initiated, failing which a `CommandException` is thrown:
    1. There does not exist another `GradedComponent` in the database with the same name as the added one.
    2. After adding the `GradedComponent`, the total weightage does not exceed 100.
5. If all checks are successful, the new `GradedComponent` is added into the database.
6. For every student in the database, the command additionally creates a student score corresponding to that student and the newly created
   `GradedComponent`, with marks initialized to 0.
7. The linkages between `Student` and `GradedComponent` are updated accordingly (ie. their corresponding `StudentScores` are added to their score lists)

Alternative Implementations:
* For step 6, we initially considered letting users add student scores on their own corresponding to an existing student ID and component name.
  However, we rejected this idea as users would likely find it very troublesome to individually create student scores, and it would also make the
  calculation of scores more convoluted. (eg. how to calculate mean for components/students with missing scores)
  se the index provided, checking that it is a valid integer from 1 to the size

### Edit Graded Component

<puml src="diagrams/EditGradedComponent.puml" width="1000" />

The `editComp` command allows users to edit a graded component's details based on its 1-based index, which are propagated to the component's associated student scores.
A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to edit a graded component, for instance `editComp 1 c/Midterm Exam w/25 mm/50`.
2. `EditGradedComponentCommandParser` checks for the  flags c/, mm/ and w/ which represent the component name, maximum mark and weightage values respectively. It performs several checks, failing which a `ParseCommandException` is thrown:
    1. The index provided is an integer between 1 and the size of the displayed `GradedComponent` list
    2. The component name, maximum marks and weightage values provided are valid. (eg. Weightage is a number between 0 and 100)
    3. There are no duplicate flags provided.
    4. At least one field to be edited must be provided.
3. An `EditGradedComponentCommandDescriptor` is created using the provided arguments. This is because the graded component list in `GradedComponentBook` is read-only, so to edit a `GradedComponent`, we will need to create a new `GradedComponent` using the descriptor, and call the `setGradedComponent` function to replace the old component with the new one.
4. An `EditGradedComponentCommand` is created and executed with the `Model`.
5. In `EditGradedComponentCommand`, more checks are performed, failing which a `CommandException` is thrown:
    1. There does not exist another `GradedComponent` in the database with the same name as the edited one.
    2. After editing the `GradedComponent`, the total weightage does not exceed 100.
    3. After editing the `GradedComponent`, none of the associated student scores exceeds its maximum mark.
6. This new graded component replaces the old one using  `setGradedComponent` in `GradedComponentBook`.
7. All associated student scores of the old `GradedComponent` have their linkages updated.

Alternative Implementations:
* We considered making the lists of `GradedComponentBook` not read-only, but decided against it at
  the time as it would require refactoring a large part of the codebase. However, this may
  create some inefficiency as the `Model` has to search through the entire `GradedComponent` list
  for the appropriate item to replace. Therefore, this is a possible extension that future developers may consider.

### Delete Graded Component

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteGradedComponentSequenceDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

The `deleteComp` command allows users to delete a graded component alongside its associated student scores based on its 1-based index.
A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to delete a graded component, for instance `deleteComp 2`.
2. `DeleteGradedComponentCommandParser` checks that the only argument provided is a valid index, which is an integer between 1 and the size of the displayed `GradedComponent` list.
3. Index is passed into `DeleteGradedComponentCommand`'s constructor which is then executed.
4. The graded component corresponding to the index in the currently displayed `GradedComponentBook` list is removed.
5. All associated student scores of that `GradedComponent` are also removed.

Alternative Implementations:
* We originally considered having users remove graded components based on their unique component name. Ultimately, we decided it would be faster for users to type in an index rather than a name (especially if it is quite lengthy),
although future developers may want to extend this functionality so that users can choose to remove by either index or component name.

### Sort Commands

The Sort related features allows NUS professors to sort the currently displayed students or student scores. When successfully executed, the sorted students or student scores will be shown on the Graphical User Interface. <br>

We will discuss the implementation of `sortScore` (Sort Student Scores) command here and omit the discussion of the implementation of `sortStu` command since it is very similar to `sortScore` command and simpler.

#### Implementation

The `sortScore` mechanism is facilitated by GradedComponentBook, StudentBook and StudentScoreBook. It implements the following operations:

* `GradedComponentBook#hasGc(GcName gcName)` - Returns true if a graded component is already created and in the graded component list.
* `studentScoreBook.sortStudentScore(Boolean isReverse)` - Filters the student scores with the given graded component and sort them according to the given reverse order.
* `studentBook.sortStudentScore(GcName gcName, Boolean isReverse)` - Sorts students by their scores in a given graded component.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `sortScore` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The GUI displayed the list of students and their student scores that the user wants to sort after some `find` or `list` commands.

Step 2. The user executes `sortStuScore c/Midterm` command to sort the current displayed lists of students and student scores. The `sortStuScore` command calls SortStudentScoreCommandParser#parse() which parses the string keyed into the command line of the GUI.

Step 3. `SortStudentScoreCommandParser#parse()` invokes the creation of a `SortStudentScoreCommand` object.
> **Note**: If a command fails its execution due to incorrect command format, it will not create a `SortStudentScoreCommand` object, an error message will be displayed and user will retype their command.

Step 4. Upon creation and execution of `SortStudentScoreCommand` object, `GradedComponentBook#hasGc(GcName gcName)`, `studentScoreBook.sortStudentScore(Boolean isReverse)` and `studentBook.sortStudentScore(GcName gcName, Boolean isReverse)` methods are called.
> **Note**: If upon invoking `GradedComponentBook#hasGc(GcName gcName)` method and return value is false, it will throw an error and will not call the remaining two methods, so the students and student scores will not be sorted.

Step 5. After successfully sorting student scores and their associated students, a `CommandResult` object will be created to tell the user that the student scores has been successfully sorted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort student scores operation works:<br>

<puml src="diagrams/SortScoreCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortScoreCommandSequenceDiagram"></puml>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `sortScore` commandï¼š<br>
<puml src="diagrams/SortScoreAcitivityDiagram.puml" alt="SortScoreActivityDiagram" />

### Stats Commands

The Stats related features allows NUS professors to calculate the statistics of student scores effectively. When successfully executed, the relevant statistics will be shown in the result display box of Graphical User Interface. <br>

We will discuss the implementation of `compStats` (calculate the statistics for a specific graded component) command here and omit the discussion of the implementation of `stats` command since it is very similar to `compStats` command and simpler.

#### Implementation

The `compStats` mechanism is facilitated by GradedComponentBook, StudentBook and StudentScoreBook. It implements the following operations:

* `GradedComponentBook#hasGc(GcName gcName)` - Returns true if a graded component is already created and in the graded component list.
* `studentBook.getStudentList()` - Returns the stored list of students.
* `compStatsCommand.generateOverallStatsSummary(List<Student> students)` - Returns a string represented all the relevant statistics.
* `statsCalculator` - A class that helps calculate different types of statistical measures.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `compStats` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `compStats c/Midterm` command to calculate the statistics of student scores of Midterm. The `compStats` command calls CompStatsCommandParser#parse() which parses the string keyed into the command line of the GUI.

Step 2. `CompStatsCommandParser#parse()` invokes the creation of a `CompStatsCommand` object.
> **Note**: If a command fails its execution due to incorrect command format, it will not create a `CompStatsCommand` object, an error message will be displayed and user will retype their command.

Step 3. Upon creation and execution of `CompStatsCommand` object, `GradedComponentBook#hasGc(GcName gcName)`, `studentBook.getStudentList()` and `compStatsCommand.generateOverallStatsSummary(List<Student> students)` methods are called.
> **Note**: If upon invoking `GradedComponentBook#hasGc(GcName gcName)` method and return value is false, it will throw an error and will not call the remaining two methods, so statistics will not be calculated and displayed.

Step 4. After successfully calculating the statistics, a `CommandResult` object will be created to show the calculated statistics.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `compStats` operation works:<br>

<puml src="diagrams/CompStatsCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortScoreCommandSequenceDiagram"></puml>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `compStats` commandï¼š<br>
<puml src="diagrams/CompStatsAcitivityDiagram.puml" alt="CompStatsActivityDiagram" />


### Auto-grading

#### Implementation

The auto-grading command uses the help of `EditStudentScommand` and `SortStuCommand` to properly assign each grade to the students. 
The `SortStuCommand` is used to find the grade threshold value for each grade, if the method used is by `percentile` (this will be explained later). 
Additionally, it creates clearer result as it sorts the students by their total score inversely. 
In a short manner, the mechanism works by finding the grade threshold for each grade and assigning the grade to each student by comparing
their total score to the previously found grade threshold.

There are 2 possible method of grading:
* Percentile Method: `percentile`
    * Calculate students' grade based on the statistical percentile. This will assign the grade for students above k-th percentile.
      `SortStuCommand` will be used to sort the students and find the students at the exact position of the grade threshold. 
      Note that it will **round up** the index to take a more lenient approach. The total score of that student will be used as the grade threshold.
* Absolute Score Method: `absolute`
    * Calculate students' grade based on the given passing grade values.
    * The absolute value is compared directly with the students' total score (in percentage of the maximum score possible).

**Important Note:**
* The `autoGrade` command works on the filtered student list. This would allow for example, to grade students only compared to their own tutorial group. To automatically grade every student in the module, `findStu` command can be used to display every student.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the auto-grading mechanism for percentile calculation behaves at each step.


Step 1. The user launch the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user creates the desired graded components, adds all the students in the cohort, and assign them with scores.

Step 3. The user then executes `autoGrade ag/percentile pg/95 70 65 50 40 30 20` to execute the auto-grading system, the `percentile`
keyword indicates that ModuLight grades based on the students' percentile compared to another. The value after `pg/` indicates
the top percentile for each corresponding grade threshold, i.e. `pg/[A+] [A] [A-] [B+] ...`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The value for `ag/` can be type `absolute` which determines the grade based on the passing score of the student's total score.

</box>

This step will first trigger the parse function and several things will be executed
1. The string argument will be parsed into the grading method and the passing value.
2. `AutoGradeCommandParser#checkAutoGradeType()` then will parse the grading method string into AutoGradeType `PERCENTILE`.
3. `AutoGradeCommandParser#mapToFloat()` will parse the passing value string into an array of float. In this step, string that is not parsable will be checked and an exception will be thrown.
   Furthermore, values less than zero or more than 100 will cause an exception to be thrown as the total mark of a student is in percentage.
   Further check on values must be decreasing is also available as lower grades cannot have higher grade threshold.
4. The parser then will return a new `AutoGradeCommand` object.

Step 4. The `AutoGradeCommand` returned will then be executed and several other things will be executed
1. This step will first trigger the `sortStuCommand` and causes the filtered student list to be updated into the sorted form. 
2. A check will be done to ensure that the inputted array of float does not pass the maximum number of values. An exception will be thrown otherwise.
3. As the grading method used in this example is `PERCENTILE`, it will then trigger `AutoGradeCommand#setGradeThresholdPercentile()` to be executed in order to calculate the
   grade threshold. 
4. It will then create an `EditStudentDescriptor` for each student in the filtered list and the assigned grade.
   The grade is determined by comparing the student's total score and the grade threshold.
5. `EditStudentCommand` will be created and executed for each student and the grade will be added.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the assignments of grade works:**

* Create new Grade object for each student.
    * Pros: Cleaner and extendable code implementation.
    * Cons: require change of implementation on multiple classes.



### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

Since `Student`, `StudentGrade` and `GradedComponent` have similar dependencies and behavior, we will use `Ssc` to refer these three classes and their related classes in the following discussion. In other words, `VersionedSscBook` means `VersionedStudentBook`, `VersionedStudentScoreBook` and `VersionedGradedComponentBook`.
The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSscBook`. It extends `SscBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `sscStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSscBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current ssc book state in its history.
* `VersionedSscBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous ssc book state from its history.
* `VersionedSscBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone ssc book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSscBook()`, `Model#undoSscBook()` and `Model#redoSscBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSscBook` will be initialized with the initial Ssc book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Ssc book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `deleteStu 5` command to delete the 5th student in the Ssc book. The `deleteStu` command calls `Model#commitSscBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `SscBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Ssc book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `addStu n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `addStu` command also calls `Model#commitSscBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `sscBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSscBook()`, so the ssc book state will not be saved into the `sscBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSscBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous ssc book state, and restores the ssc book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SscBook state, then there are no previous SscBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSscBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoSscBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ssc book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `sscBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone SscBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSscBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listAll`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSscBook()`, `Model#undoSscBook()` or `Model#redoSscBook()`. Thus, the `sscBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clearAll`, which calls `Model#commitSscBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `sscBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ssc book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteStu`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**

NUS professors who:
* have a need to manage a significant number of students and assessments in a single module
* are beginners to intermediate in spreadsheet technology
* prefer typing over interacting with the GUI with the mouse
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
* NUS professors need a convenient system to manage students and assessments. We propose a program to track students and their performance on graded components, utility functions to get statistics on the cohort and certain subgroups, ability to tag students (e.g. dropped module, potential TA etc.), alongside general GUI improvements.

   1. Test case: `addStu n/John Doe s/A1234567Y e/john@gmail.com g/T07`
      Expected: If there is already a person with the same student ID in ModuLight an error message will appear in the feedback box.
      Otherwise, a new student with name `John Doe`, student id `A1234567Y`, email `john@gmail.com` and tutorial group `T07` will be created and displayed in the student list.
      If there exists graded component in the graded component list, new student scores that belongs to this student will be added.

   2. Test case: `addStu n/Jane Plain s/A1111111Y e/jane@gmail.com`
      Expected: If there is already a person with the same student ID in ModuLight an error message will appear in the feedback box.
      Otherwise, a new student with name `Jane Plain`, student id `A1111111Y`, email `jane@gmail.com` and default tutorial group `T00` will be created and displayed in the student list.
      If there exists graded component in the graded component list, new student scores that belongs to this student will be added.
   
   3. Test case: `addStu n/Amy e/amy@gamil.com`
      Expected: An error message of Invalid command format will be displayed in the feedback box, as the student id parameter is missing.
      
   
### Deleting a student

    1. Prerequisite: displayed student list and student score list are not empty and a graded component with name "Midterm" is created.
    
       1. Test case: `sortScore c/Midterm`
          Expected: Only Midterm student scores are shown, and they are sorted in the ascending order.
          
       2. Test case: `sortScore c/Final` (Assuming there is no such graded component with name "Final")
          Expected: An error message that states "This graded component is not created. Please check if the information is correct" is shown.


### Calculating Statistics

### Saving and Loading data

1. Dealing with missing files

   1. Delete all three json files `studentBook.json`, `gradedComponentBook.json`, `scoreBook.json`.
   
   2. Run the program. <br>
      Expected: The program will load with the original sample data just like it was run for the first time.

2. Dealing with corrupted files

    1. Open `studentBook.json`.

    2. Edit any "studentName" field and input "R@chel".

    3. Run the program. <br>
       Expected: The program will load with completely empty data instead of edited data.

    4. Other ways to corrupt the files are to change "tutorialGroup" to "AAA", "gcName" (in `gradedComponentBook.
       json`) to "@Quiz", ...

    5. Run the program. <br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

1. Manually editing data files
    
    1. Open `studentBook.json`.
   
    2. Edit any "studentName" field and input "Rachel" or some other name which contains alphanumeric characters.

    3. Run the program. <br>
       Expected: The program will load with the updated studentName.

## **Appendix: Effort**
### **Challenges**
AB-3 mainly deals with one entity type, which is person. The implementation of MuduLight is more complicated as we have three entities:
student, student score and graded components who related to each other. For example, a student score belongs to a student and a graded components, 
and every student and graded component entity contains a list of student scores.

In the implementation, we have carefully considered the interconnectedness of the entities and made sure that our features
addresses the relationships. For example, when a student is deleted from the database, all student scores related to this student will be deleted
as well, as it is pointless to keep them when they belong to no student.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Support special characters in student name parameter as some people's legal name do include some special characters(e.g. "s/o").
2. Allow the Student List Panel, Student Score List Panel and Graded Component List Panel to automatically scroll down when adding new Student, Student Grade or Graded Component.
3. Include visualisation of statistics by plotting graphs.
4. Support more flexible search methods that find the entity of interest despite small inaccuracies(e.g. typo) in the search keyword.
5. Support storage and display of student photos to help the professors recognise and identify their students.
