## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands through the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data through the `Logic` component so that the UI can be updated with the modified
  data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, referenced through the `Logic` component as it displays `Customer`
  and `Delivery` objects residing in the
  `Model`.

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Logic component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component,
taking `execute("customer delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="note" background-color="#dff0d8" border-color="#d6e9c6" icon=":information_source:">

**Note:** The lifeline for `CustomerDeleteCommandParser` and `CustomerDeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (
X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `CustomerDeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `CustomerDeleteCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- when called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CustomerAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above
  to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CustomerAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser`
  returns back as a `Command` object.
- all `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CustomerAddCommandParser`, `DeliveryDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
  the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Model component

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)


<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="900" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Customer` objects. (See the [ReadOnlyBook Model](#readonlybook-model) section
  below for more details)
* stores the delivery book data i.e., all `Delivery` objects. (See the [ReadOnlyBook Model](#readonlybook-model) section
  below for more details)
* stores the currently filtered `Customer` objects (See the [Customer Model](#customer-model)) as a separate
  _filteredCustomers_ list. (e.g., results of a `customer list` command)
* stores the currently filtered `Delivery` objects (See the [Delivery Model](#delivery-model)) as a separate
  _filteredDeliveries_ list. (e.g., results of a `delivery list --status COMPLETED` command)
* stores the currently sorted `Delivery` objects as a separate _sortedDeliveries_ list. (eg., results of
  a `delivery list --sort ASC` command)
* stores a `User` object that represents the stored user's data (See the [User Model](#user-model)).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* stores an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ListItem>` that exposes the `Customer` or `Delivery`  details that is
  shown on the UI list panel that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically
  updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="note" background-color="#dff0d8" border-color="#d6e9c6" icon=":information_source:">

**Note:** Due to a limitation of PlantUML, we are putting both multiplicity and association role on the same line.
</box>


<br>

#### ReadOnlyBook Model

<puml src="diagrams/ReadOnlyBookClassDiagram.puml" width="350" />

The `ReadOnlyBook` model,

* exposes the `AddressBook` and `DeliveryBook` to the outside.
* The `AddressBook` class stores the address book data i.e., all `Customer` that are contained through
  the `UniqueCustomerList`.
* the `DeliveryBook` class stores the delivery book data i.e., all `Delivery` that are contained through
  the `UniqueDeliveryList`.

<br>

#### User Model

<puml src="diagrams/UserClassDiagram.puml" width="300" />

The `User` model,

* stores the user data i.e, the username, password, secret question and answer of the user.

<br>

#### Delivery Model

<puml src="diagrams/DeliveryClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

The `Delivery` model,

* stores the delivery data i.e, the delivery ID, delivery name, customer, delivery status, order date,
  expected delivery date and note for the delivery.

<br>

#### Customer Model

<puml src="diagrams/CustomerClassDiagram.puml" width="350" />

The `Customer` model,

* stores the customer data i.e, the customer ID, phone, email, name and address.

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save user preference data, address book data and delivery book data in JSON format,
* and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from  `UserPrefStorage`
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

The concrete implementation of storage is done through `StorageManger`, which holds an instance of `UserPrefsStorage`,
`BookStorage` and `BookStorageWithReference`. Which represents the User Preference Data, Address Book and Delivery Book
respectively.

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

### **Register Command**

#### Overview

The `register` command is used to register a new user account.
Once registered, the user will be able to log in to the account and access all the commands available.

The format for the `register` command can be found [here](UserGuide.md#register).

#### Feature Details

1. The user executes the `register` command.
2. If a stored user exists, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the command completes successfully, the user will be registered and logged in.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of a user registering an account:

<puml src="diagrams/UserRegisterActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UserRegisterActivityDiagram" />

The sequence of the `register` command is as follows:

1. The command `register --user USERNAME --password PASSWORD --confirmPass CONFIRM_PASSWORD
   --secretQn SECRET_QUESTION --answer ANSWER`
   is entered by the user (i.e., `register --user gab --password pass1234 --confirmPass
   pass1234 --secretQn First Pet? --answer Koko`).
2. `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with the full user input.
3. The `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, creating a new instance of `UserRegisterCommandParser`,
   thereafter calling `UserRegisterCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `UserRegisterCommandParser` will parse the arguments, create a new `User` and return a new instance
   of `UserRegisterCommand`,
   which is in turn passed back to `AddressBookParser` then back to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `UserRegisterCommand#execute` with the `Model` instance as input,
   which checks if a user is already registered by calling `Model#getStoredUser`.
6. If no user is registered, `UserRegisterCommand` calls `Model#registerUser` to store the user.
7. Finally, `UserRegisterCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution
   and returns it back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `register` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/UserRegisterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UserRegisterSequenceDiagram" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Login Command**

#### Overview

The `login` command is used to log in to the user's account.
Once logged in, the user will have access to all the commands available.

The format for the `login` command can be found [here](UserGuide.md#login).

#### Feature Details

1. The user specifies the `Username` and `Password` in the `login` command.
2. If there is no registered account found, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the user is currently already logged in, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. The `User` is then cross-referenced with the stored user in `Model` to check if the credentials match.
   If incorrect credentials are provided, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
5. If the command completes successfully, the user will be logged in and the
   `isLoggedIn` status in `Model` will be updated to `true`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram shows the logic of a user logging in:

<puml src="diagrams/UserLoginActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UserLoginActivityDiagram" />

The sequence of the `login` command is as follows:

1. Upon launching the application, the `ModelManager` will be initialized with
   the `User` constructed with details from the authentication.json file.
2. The command `login --user USERNAME --password PASSWORD` is entered by the user (
   e.g. `login --user Gabriel435 --password 12345678`)
3. `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with `login --user USERNAME --password PASSWORD` as input.
4. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command and creates a new instance of `UserLoginCommandParser`, thereafter
   calling `UserLoginCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
5. `UserLoginCommandParser` will parse the arguments, create a new `User` instance, and return a new instance
   of `UserLoginCommand`. This `UserLoginCommand` instance is then returned to `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` calls `UserLoginCommand#execute` with the Model instance as input, which checks whether there is a
   registered account stored by calling
   `Model#getStoredUser`.
7. The `UserLoginCommand` then checks whether the user is currently logged in by calling `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
8. After that, the `UserLoginCommand` checks if the user credentials match the stored user by
   calling `Model#userMatches`.
9. If the user is not logged in and the credentials match, the `UserLoginCommand` calls `Model#setLoginSuccess`,
   changing the login status to true and giving the user access to all the commands.
10. The `userLoginCommand` also calls `Model#showAllFilteredCustomerList` to display the list of customers.
11. Finally, `UserLoginCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and returns it
    back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `login` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/UserLoginSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UserLoginSequenceDiagram" />

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Logout Command**

#### Overview

The `logout` command is used to log out from the user's account.
Once logged out, the user will have no access to all the commands available, except for `help`, `exit`,
`register`, `login`, `recover` and `delete account`.

The format for the `logout` command can be found [here](UserGuide.md#logout).

#### Feature Details

1. The user executes the `logout` command.
2. If the user is already logged out, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the command completes successfully, the user will be logged out and the
   `isLoggedIn` status in `Model` will be updated to `false`.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of a user logging out:

<puml src="diagrams/UserLogoutActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UserLogoutActivityDiagram" />

The sequence of the `logout` command is as follows:

1. The command `logout` is entered by the user.
2. `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with `logout` as input.
3. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, and create a new instance of
   `UserLogoutCommand`. This instance is then returned to `LogicManager`.
4. Then, `LogicManager` calls `UserLogoutCommand#execute` with the Model instance as input, which checks if the user is
   logged in by calling `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
5. If the user is currently logged in, the `UserLogoutCommand` calls `Model#setLogoutSuccess`,
   changing the login status to false and restricting the user access to most commands.
6. The `UserLogoutCommand` also calls `Model#clearFilteredDeliveryList` and `Model#clearFilteredCustomerList` to hide
   the list of deliveries and customers.
7. Finally, `UserLogoutCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and returns it
   back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `logout` command works:


<puml src="diagrams/UserLogoutSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UserLogoutSequenceDiagram" width="900" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><br/>

### **Customer Add Command**

#### Overview

The `customer add` command is used to create a new customer with information fields `Name`, `Phone`, `Email` and
`Address`. A unique `ID` will be assigned to the customer upon creation.

The format for the `customer add` command can be found [here](UserGuide.md#add-a-customer).

#### Feature Details

1. The user executes the `customer add` command.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the Customer already exists in the database, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the command completes successfully, the `Customer` will be added to the `Customer` database.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of adding a `Customer` into the database:

<puml src="diagrams/CustomerAddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="CustomerAddActivityDiagram" />

The sequence of the `customer add` command is as follows:

1. The User executes the `customer add` command.
2. `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` on the command.
3. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, and creates a new instance of `CustomerAddCommandParser`, thereafter
   calling
   `CustomerAddCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `CustomerAddCommandParser` will parse the arguments, and creates a new `Customer` instance, followed by a new
   instance of `CustomerAddCommand` using the `Customer` instance as a parameter.
5. `CustomerAddCommand` instance is then passed back to `AddressBookParser` instance, which then passes it back
   to `LogicManager`.
6. `LogicManager` calls `CustomerAddCommand#execute` with the `Model` instance as input, which checks if the user is
   logged in by calling the
   `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
7. Thereafter, the `CustomerAddCommand` instance checks if the `Customer` exists in `Model` using `Model#hasCustomer`.
8. If the `Customer` does not exist, `CustomerAddCommand` calls `Model#addCustomer` to add the `Customer` into the
   database.
9. Finally, `CustomerAddCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and returns it
   back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `customer add` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/CustomerAddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CustomerAddSequenceDiagram" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Customer Edit Command**

#### Overview

The `customer edit` command is used to edit an existing Customer with at least one of the information fields
specified by the user, namely the customer's `Name`, `Phone`, `Email` or/and `Address`.

The format for the `customer edit` command can be found [here](UserGuide.md#update-details-of-a-customer).

#### Feature Details

1. The user executes the `customer edit` command.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the provided `ID` does not match any of the existing Customer IDs, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the edits result in a duplicate Customer, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
5. If the command completes successfully, the Customer will be edited with the new information provided by the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram shows the logic of a user editing a customer's information:

<puml src="diagrams/Gabriels Diagrams/CustomerEditActivityDiagram.puml" alt="CustomerEditActivityDiagram" />

The sequence of the `customer edit` command is as follows:

1. The command `customer edit CUSTOMER_ID --name NAME --phone PHONE --email EMAIL --address ADDRESS` is entered by the
   user.
2. LogicManager calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`
   with `customer edit CUSTOMER_ID --name NAME --phone PHONE --email EMAIL --address ADDRESS` as input.
3. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, and creates a new instance of `CustomerEditCommandParser`, thereafter
   calling `CustomerEditCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `CustomerEditCommandParser` will call its own `CustomerEditCommandParser#createCustomerEditDescriptor` method which
   in turn creates a new `CustomerEditDescriptor` instance with the parsed arguments and returns it
   to `CustomerEditCommandParser`.
5. `CustomerEditCommandParser` then creates a `CustomerEditCommand` instance and returns it to `AddressBookParser`.
6. `AddressBookParser` then passes the `CustomerEditCommand` instance to `LogicManager`.
7. `LogicManager` then calls `CustomerEditCommand#execute` with the `Model` instance as input.
8. The `CustomerEditCommand` instance then checks if the user is logged in by calling `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
9. Thereafter, the `CustomerEditCommand` calls its own `CustomerEditCommand#createEditedCustomer` method which in turn
   creates a new `Customer` instance with the edited information provided by the user.
10. This `Customer` instance is returned to `CustomerEditCommand`. `CustomerEditCommand` then calls `Model#setCustomer`
    to update the existing `Customer` with the new information provided by the user.
11. The `CustomerEditCommand` then calls `CustomerEditCommand#updateDelivery` to update `Deliveries` associated with
    this updated `Customer`.
12. `Model#showAllFilteredCustomerList` is then called to display the updated list of customers.
13. Finally, `CustomerEditCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and returns
    it back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `customer edit` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/Gabriels Diagrams/CustomerEditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CustomerEditSequenceDiagram" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Delivery Add Command**

#### Overview

The `delivery add` command is used to add a new Delivery with all the given information fields
specified by the user, namely the delivery's `DeliveryName`, customer id of a `Customer` and `DeliveryDate`. All fields
are compulsory.

The format for the `delivery add` command can be found [here](UserGuide.md#add-a-delivery).

#### Feature Details

1. The user executes the `delivery add` command.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the provided Customer ID does not match any of the existing Customer IDs, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the expected Delivery date is before the current date, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
5. If the command completes successfully, the Delivery will be added to the Delivery database.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of a user adding a delivery:

<puml src="diagrams/Gabriels Diagrams/DeliveryAddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeliveryAddActivityDiagram" />

The sequence of the `delivery add` command is as follows:

1. The user inputs the `delivery add` command with `input` as the `DeliveryName`, Customer ID of a `Customer` and
   `DeliveryDate`.
   e.g.(`delivery add --name Chocolate Cake --customer 1 --date 2024-10-10`)
2. The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with `input` as input.
3. The `AddressBookParser` in turn creates an instance of `DeliveryAddCommandParser` and calls
   `DeliveryAddCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. The `DeliveryAddCommandParser` then creates a `DeliveryAddDescriptor` instance.
5. A new `DeliveryAddCommand` instance is then created by `DeliveryAddCommandParser`.
6. The `DeliveryAddCommand` instance is then returned to `AddressBookParser`, and finally to the `LogicManager`
   where `DeliveryAddCommand#execute` method is called with `Model` instance as input.
7. The `DeliveryAddCommand` then calls upon `Model#getUserLoginStatus` to check if the user is logged in.
8. The `DeliveryAddCommand` then calls its own `DeliveryAddCommand#createDelivery` method which creates a new `Delivery`
   instance using the `DeliveryAddDescriptor` instance created earlier.
9. The `DeliveryAddCommand` then calls the `Model#addDelivery` method to add the newly created `Delivery` instance into
   the database.
10. Finally, the `DeliveryAddCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and
    returns it back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delivery add` command works:

### **Delivery View Command**

#### Overview

The `delivery view` command is used to view a selected delivery with the id specified by the user.

The format of the `delivery view` command can be found
[here](./UserGuide.md#view-details-of-a-delivery).

#### Feature Details

1. The user will specify a `Delivery` through its `ID`.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the provided `ID` does not match any of the existing Delivery IDs, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the command completes successfully, the details of the specified `Delivery` will be shown.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram illustrates the logic of viewing a `Delivery`.

<puml src="diagrams/implementation/delivery/DeliveryViewActivityDiagram.puml" width="600" />

The sequence of the `delivery view` command is as follows:

1. The command `delivery view DELIVERY_ID` is entered by the user (e.g. `delivery view 1`).
2. `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with `delivery view DELIVERY_ID` as input.
3. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, and creates a new instance of `DeliveryViewCommandParser` thereafter
   calling
   `DeliveryViewCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `DeliveryViewCommandParser` will parse the arguments, and return a new instance of `DeliveryViewCommand`. This
   instance is then returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `DeliveryViewCommand#execute` with the Model instance as input, which checks if the user is
   logged in by calling
   `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
6. Thereafter, the `DeliveryViewCommand` instance fetches the `Delivery` with the specified `DELIVERY_ID` from `Model`,
   calling `Model#getDelivery`.
7. Finally, `DeliveryViewCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and returns it
   back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

### **Delivery List Command**

#### Overview

The `delivery list` command is used to list all deliveries in the delivery book.

The format of the `delivery list` command can be found
[here](./UserGuide.md#view-a-list-of-deliveries).

#### Feature Details

1. The user can optionally specify a `status`, `customer id`, `date` and `sort` to filter and sort the
   current delivery list in any combination.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the status was provided, the status is added as a filter.
4. If the Customer ID was provided, the Customer ID is added as a filter.
5. If the date was provided, the date is added as an expected delivery date filter.
6. The delivery list will be filtered by the filters created, if any.
7. If the filtered list is empty, the application informs the user of empty list and the command execution ends.
8. If the sort was provided, the sort provided is added as the sort. By default, a descending order sort is
   added as a sort.
9. The delivery list will be sorted by the sort created.
10. If the command completes successfully, the list of deliveries is displayed to the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram illustrates the logic for listing `Delivery`:

<puml src="diagrams/implementation/delivery/DeliveryListActivityDiagram.puml" width="800"> </puml>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence of the `delivery list` command is as follows:

1. The command `delivery list --status STATUS --customer CUSTOMER_ID --date EXPECTED_DELIVERY_DATE --sort SORT` is
   entered by the user
   (e.g. `delivery list --status created --customer 1 --date 2023-12-12 --sort ASC`).
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with the full user input.
3. The `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, creating a new instance of `DeliveryListCommandParser`,
   thereafter calling `DeliveryListCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `DeliveryListCommandParser#parse` will call `DeliveryListCommandParser#parseDeliveryListCommand`to parse the
   arguments and return a new instance of `DeliveryListCommand`, which is in turn passed back to `AddressBookParser`
   then back to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `DeliveryListCommand#execute` with the `Model` as input, which checks if the user is logged in
   by calling `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
6. Thereafter, `DeliveryListCommand` will call `DeliveryListCommand#createDeliveryListFilters` to create
   the filters based on the parsed arguments, if any.
7. `DeliveryListCommand` will call `Model#updateFilteredDeliveryList(Predicate)` to filter the delivery list by
   the filters created.
8. `DeliveryListCommand` will call `DeliveryListCommand#createDeliveryListSort()` to create the sort for the delivery
   list by expected delivery date based on the parsed arguments, if any, or by default, create the sort in descending
   expected delivery date.
9. `DeliveryListCommand` will call `Model#updateSortedDeliveryList(Comparator)` to sort the delivery list by the sort
   created.
10. Finally, `DeliveryListCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution
    and returns it back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The default delivery sort is `desc` which sorts the delivery list by expected delivery date in descending order from
the latest date to the earliest date.

### **Delivery Status Command**

#### Overview

The `delivery status` command is used to update the `DeliveryStatus` of a selected delivery with the new status
specified by the user.

The format of the `delivery status` command can be found
[here](./UserGuide.md#update-status-of-a-delivery).

#### Feature Details

1. The user will specify a `Delivery` through its `ID`. The user must specify a `DeliveryStatus` to replace the
   current status of the selected delivery.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the provided `ID` does not match any of the existing Delivery IDs, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the command completes successfully, the status of the `Delivery` with the specified Delivery ID will be updated to
   the new status.

The following activity diagram illustrates the logic of updating the `DeliveryStatus` of a `Delivery`:

<puml src="diagrams/DeliveryStatusCommandActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The sequence of the `delivery status` command is as follows:

1. The command `delivery status DELIVERY_ID STATUS` is entered by the user (e.g. `delivery status 1 completed`)
2. `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with `delivery status DELIVERY_ID STATUS` as input.
3. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, and creates a new instance of `DeliveryStatusCommandParser`, thereafter
   calling
   `DeliveryStatusCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `DeliveryStatusCommandParser` will parse the arguments, and return a new instance of `DeliveryStatusCommand` which is
   in turn passed back to `AddressBookParser` then back to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `DeliveryStatusCommand#execute` with the Model instance as input, which checks if the user is
   logged in by calling
   `Model#getUserLoginStatus()`.
6. Thereafter, the `DeliveryStatusCommand` instance fetches the `Delivery` with the specified `DELIVERY_ID` from `Model`
   , then calls it's own `DeliveryStatusCommand#createDeliveryWithNewStatus` method to create a new `Delivery` with the
   updated `DeliveryStatus`.
7. It then replaces the existing `Delivery` with the same ID in the `Model`
   using `Model#setDelivery` with the newly created `Delivery` with identical fields except for its
   updated `DeliveryStatus`.
8. Finally, `DeliveryStatusCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and returns
   it back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the `delivery status` command sequence:

### **Delivery Note Command**

#### Overview

The `delivery note` command is used to create a new `Note` a selected delivery with the new note
specified by the user

The format of the `delivery note` command can be found
[here](./UserGuide.md#create-a-note-for-a-delivery).

#### Feature Details

1. The user will specify a `Delivery` through its `id`. The user must specify a non-empty `Note` to replace the
   current status of the selected delivery.
2. If the user is not logged in during command execution, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
3. If the provided `ID` does not match any of the existing Delivery IDs, a `CommandException` will be thrown.
4. If the command completes successfully, the selected `Delivery` will be updated with the new `Note`.

The following activity diagram illustrates the logic of creating a `Note` for a `Delivery`:

<puml src="diagrams/DeliveryCreateNoteActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The sequence of the `delivery note` command is as follows:

1. The command `delivery note DELIVERY_ID --note NOTE` is entered by the user
   (e.g. `delivery note 1 --note This is a note`).
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with `delivery note DELIVERY_ID --note NOTE` as input.
3. `AddressBookParser` will parse the command, and creates a new instance of `DeliveryCreateNoteCommandParser`,
   thereafter calling `DeliveryCreateNoteCommandParser#parse` to parse the command arguments.
4. `DeliveryCreateNoteCommandParser` will parse the arguments, and return a new instance of `DeliveryCreateNoteCommand`,
   which is in turn passed back to `AddressBookParser` then back to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `DeliveryCreateNoteCommand#execute` with the `Model` instance as input,
   which checks if the user is logged in by calling `Model#getUserLoginStatus`.
6. Thereafter, the `DeliveryCreateNoteCommand` instance fetchs the `Delivery` with the specified `DELIVERY_ID`,
   from `Model` then calls it's own `DeliveryCreateNoteCommand#createDeliveryWithNewNote` method
   to create a new `Delivery` with the updated `Note`.
7. It then replaces the existing `Delivery` with the same ID in the `Model` using `Model#setDelivery` with
   the newly created `Delivery` with identical fields except for its updated `Note`.
8. Finally, `DeliveryCreateNoteCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` instance with the result of the execution and
   returns it back to `LogicManager` which then returns it to the UI.

If the specified `Delivery` already has an existing `Note`, it will be overridden by the new `Note` supplied if the
command executes successfully.

The following diagram illustrates the `delivery note` command sequence:

### Planned Enhancements

1. Our ID generation is not consistent (e.g., If there are 5 customers with `ID` 1-5 and the last 4 are deleted, the
   next
   `ID` will be `6`. However, if you restart the application, the next created Customer will have `ID` of `2`.)
   Currently, we
   only reset the next available ID to (max `ID` + `1`) when the user closes and launches the program again. Other
   times, it
   might skip a few numbers depending on the operations performed. We plan to perform this clean up operation (
   where `ID`
   resets to (max `ID` + `1`)) after every command that modifies the data. This will ensure that the next available `ID`
   is
   always (max `ID` + 1) and also help in keeping the `ID` generation more consistent and be more space efficient.

2. Currently, you are unable to key in special characters for the name of a customer or for delivery notes. We plan to
   allow certain special characters only such as `/` for the name of a customer as some people have special characters
   eg. `Gabriel s/o Bryan` in their name or require special characters when taking notes.

3. Currently, there is an inconsistency in Command Format in terms of whether a prefix is required in a command despite
   having the same number of parameters which may cause confusion for the user. For example, `delivery note` requires
   a `--note` prefix while `delivery status` does not require a prefix at all even though both have 1 parameter. We plan
   to make our command format for consistent by having delivery status require a `--status` prefix to make it more
   predictable.

4. Currently, the `find` command requires exact match of keywords and returns results that matches any of those
   keywords. This potentially results in numerous in unwanted data to be shown if there are multiple matching keywords.
   Or, if there are no matching keywords, no results would be shown. For example, if you have `100` Chocolate Cake
   and `100` Strawberry Buns and `1` Chocolate Buns, and you search for Chocolate Buns, the result would be `100`
   Chocolate Cake and `1` Chocolate Buns and `100` Strawberry Buns. Or, if you misspelled your search as `Chcolate Bns`,
   you would receive no result. We plan to make the `find` command have more options to do more complex search
   functionalities such as fuzzy search and exact match search. For example, if you search for Chocolate Buns, with
   exact search, the result would be `1` Chocolate Buns. Or, if you misspelled your search as `Chcolate Bns`, with fuzzy
   search, the result would be `1` Chocolate Buns.

5. Currently, there is no proper precedence of errors which may cause confusion among users. For example, keying in an
   invalid command format for `customer edit` while logged out will show all the errors regarding the format first
   before it tells that you are logged out (once the command format is valid and evaluated). This may result in time
   wasted as you need to then login first before re-typing your command again. Thus, we plan to set a precedence of
   error
   so that more important errors such as authentication errors are shown first and make errors more consistent in the
   order of how it is displayed.

6. Currently, if you input an invalid ID, it simply
   states `"ID must be an integer more than 0 and less than 2147483648."`
   but does not state whether it is a Delivery ID or Customer ID.
   We plan to make the error message more specific by stating whether it is a Delivery ID or Customer ID.

7. Currently, only the user password is the only thing that is hashed in the authentication file. We plan to encrypt the
   whole JSON authentication file and the data to prevent unauthorised access to the user's account and data
   instead of only hashing the user password.

8. Currently, if you input an invalid day, month or year such as `2023-02-30`, it simply states
   date `"Dates should be in
   the format yyyy-MM-dd"` but does not specify why it is invalid. We plan to make the error more specific by stating
   what is the actual invalid input of the date, in this case, the day is invalid as 30th February does not exist.

9. Currently, you can put duplicate prefixes for delivery list to filter or sort the deliveries that may arise in
   confusion by which filter is applied. We plan to disallow duplicate prefixes for delivery list so that users would
   not be confused by the output.

10. Currently, inputting a negative value or zero for some numerical parameters that requires a positive integer simply
    states `"Invalid Command Format"`. The error message
    should be more specific and state `"Please enter a positive integer that is more than 0 and less than 2147483648."`.

<box type="note" background-color="#dff0d8" border-color="#d6e9c6" icon=":information_source:">

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

</box> 

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch.

    1. Download the jar file and copy it into an empty folder.

    2. Run `HomeBoss.jar`{.swift}. If you are unsure how to run a `.jar` file, you may refer to this helpful
       [guide](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Run-JAR-file-example-windows-linux-ubuntu)
       .

    3. First register for HomeBoss using the `register`{.swift} command. So, for example, if you want to register an
       account
       with the following details:

       > `USERNAME`: Alex123
       > `PASSWORD`: AlexIsGreat
       > `CONFIRM_PASSWORD`: AlexIsGreat
       > `SECRET_QUESTION`: First Pet Name?
       > `ANSWER`: KoKo

       Type `register --user Alex123 --password AlexIsGreat --confirmPass AlexIsGreat --secretQn First Pet Name?
       --answer Koko`{.swift} into the Command Box and hit enter. More details on the command can be
       found [here](#register).

    4. Expected: Should see the HomeBoss Homepage.

2. Subsequent launches.

    1. Relaunch the application by running `HomeBoss.jar`{.swift}.

    2. Using the `login`{.swift} command, log in into HomeBoss with the same user details entered earlier.
       Expected: User is able to log in successfully and see the HomeBoss homepage.

<br>

### Register

1. Registering for an account.

    1. Prerequisites: None

    2. Test
       Case: `register --user Gabriel --password GabrielIsGreat --confirmPass GabrielIsGreat --secretQn First Pet Name? --answer Koko`
       {.swift}.</br>
       Expected: A new user account is registered with username `Gabriel`{.swift}, password `GabrielIsGreat`{.swift},

## **Appendix: Effort**

<br>

### Difficulty level

This project was moderately challenging as we had to deal with a large existing code base.
It took us some time to understand how the different components interact with each other.
Furthermore, our team was not familiar with frameworks such as JavaFX prior to this, and we had to learn how to use it.

<br>

### Challenges faced

* Understanding and refactoring the code base
    * As HomeBoss deals with Customers and Deliveries, we had to refactor `Person` into `Customer`, and irrelevant
      classes such as `Tag` has to be removed.
* Creating storage for Deliveries
    * AB3 deals with only one storage. However, HomeBoss has two storages, one for Customers and one for Deliveries.
      Furthermore, there is a dependency between the two entities, requiring a new `BookStorageWithReference`
      class that accepts two type parameters to be created.
* Adapting the `PersonListPanel` to `ListPanel`
    * The `PersonListPanel` was designed to contain a list of `Person`. However, as we decided to display both
      `Customer` and `Delivery` in the same list, we had to adapt the `PersonListPanel` to `ListPanel` to
      accommodate both types of entities.
* Figuring out how to implement a secure login/logout system
    * As one of the feature of HomeBoss is security, we had to figure out and implement the hashing of user password
      and how to store the data related to the account.

<br>

### Achievements

* Added security feature to prevent unauthorised access to the application.
* Displaying the list of Customers and list of Deliveries using the same panel.
* Creating a new storage for Deliveries that has references to Customer.
* A refreshing look of the UI.
* New features such as filtering and sorting of deliveries.
* Increasing code coverage to 83.5%.
