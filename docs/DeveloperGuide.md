### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete EID1234-5678`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.

* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete EID1234-5678")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete EID1234-5678` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an employee).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Employee` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEmployeeList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Employee` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Department` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Employee` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Department` object per unique department, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Department` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Employee feature

The add employee feature allows HouR to add employees to the employee list.

#### Implementation

The add employee command mechanism is facilitated by the `AddCommandParser` class which implements the `Parser` interface.

`AddCommandParser#parse()` is exposed in the `Parser` interface as `Parser#parse()`.

`AddCommandParser` implements the following operations:

* `AddCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input arguments by storing the prefixes of its respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap`, and creates a new `AddCommand` object with the parsed employee ID, name, phone, email, position, salary, and an optional set of departments.

The `AddCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the `Model#addEmployee(Employee)` method, which adds the newly-constructed employee to the existing employee list.

The method `AddCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The diagram below details how the operation of adding an employee works.

![Add Sequence Diagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `add id/EMPLOYEE_ID n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL pos/POSITION s/SALARY d/DEPARTMENT` command in the CLI.

**Step 3**: A new employee will be added to the employee list with the given details.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the add command:

![Add Activity Diagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command-Model Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Utilise `model#addEmployee` to add the new employee into the model instead of doing the direct editing in `AddCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requiring more parts to work together.

* **Alternative 2**: Edit the employee list directly from `AddCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: Shorter command execution, one less point of failure by eliminating the `model` class.
    * Cons: May violate immutability within Employee and Model classes as well as SLAP by having `AddCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.

### Delete Employee feature

The delete employee feature allows HouR to delete employees from the employee list.

#### Implementation

The delete employee command mechanism is facilitated by the `DeleteCommandParser` class which implements the `Parser` interface.

`DeleteCommandParser#parse()` is exposed in the `Parser` interface as `Parser#parse()`.

`DeleteCommandParser` implements the following operations:

* `DeleteCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input argument by storing the ID, and creates a new `DeleteCommand` object with the parsed ID.

The `DeleteCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the `Model#deleteEmployee(Employee)` method, which deletes the employee with the given ID from the existing employee list.

The method `DeleteCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The diagram below details how the operation of deleting an employee works.

![Delete Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `delete EMPLOYEE_ID` command in the CLI.

**Step 3**: The employee with the given ID will be deleted from the employee list.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the delete command:

![Delete Activity Diagram](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command-Model Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Utilise `model#deleteEmployee` to delete the employee from the model instead of doing the direct editing in `DeleteCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requiring more parts to work together.

* **Alternative 2**: Edit the employee list directly from `DeleteCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: Shorter command execution, one less point of failure by eliminating the `model` class.
    * Cons: May violate immutability within Employee and Model classes as well as SLAP by having `DeleteCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.

### Find Employee feature

The find employee feature allows HouR to find employees that match the given search criteria from the employee list.

#### Implementation

The find employee command mechanism is facilitated by the `FindCommandParser` class which implements the `Parser` interface.

`FindCommandParser#parse()` is exposed in the `Parser` interface as `Parser#parse()`.

`FindCommandParser` implements the following operations:

* `FindCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input argument, splits it into an array of keywords, creates an instance of `EmployeeContainsKeywordsPredicate` using the keywords, and creates a new `FindCommand` object with the newly-created predicate instance.

The `FindCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the `Model#updateFilteredEmployeeList(Predicate)` method, which updates the view of the application to show all employees that match the given search criteria.

The method `FindCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The diagram below details how the operation of finding an employee works.

![Find Sequence Diagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]â€¦â€‹` command in the CLI.

**Step 3**: The employee list will be updated to show only employees that match the given search criteria.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the find command:

![Find Activity Diagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command-Model Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Utilise `model#updateFilteredEmployeeList` to update the view of the application to show all employees that match the given search criteria.
    * Pros: Maintains data, maintain immutability within the FindCommand and Model classes.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requiring more parts to work together.

* **Alternative 2**: Edit the employee list directly from `FindCommand#execute()` to display only employees that match the given search criteria.
   * Pros: Shorter command execution, one less point of failure by eliminating the `model` class.
   * Cons: May violate immutability within FindCommand and Model classes as well as SLAP by having `FindCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommandParser`. It implements the following operations:

* `SortCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input arguments by storing the prefixes of its respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap`,
and creates a new `SortCommand` object with the parsed field and order.

The `SortCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the following methods:

* `Model#updateSortedEmployeeList(field, order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Calls `sortEmployees` method of `AddressBook` class.
* `AddressBook#sortEmployees(field, order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Calls `sortEmployees` method of `UniqueEmployeeList` class.
* `UniqueEmployeeList#sortEmployees(field, order)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the internal list according to the field and order given.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the sort operation works:

![Sort Sequence Diagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command:

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `sort f/FIELD in/ORDER` command in the CLI
(note that only `name`, `salary`, `overtime` and `leaves` fields, as well as `asc` and `desc` orders are valid).

**Step 3**: The list of all employees in the employee book will be sorted accordingly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the sort command:

![Sort Activity Diagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How sort executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sorts the internal list directly
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Disable the ability to list by order of employee added.

* **Alternative 2:** Performs a sort on a copied list in `ModelManager`.
    * Pros: Allows the `list` command to list all employees by the order they were added.
    * Cons: Different lists in the `ModelManager` class may cause inconsistencies when `find` and `sort` commands are called consecutively.

### Add Leave feature

The add leave feature allows HouR to manage employee leaves.

#### Implementation

The add leave command mechanism is facilitated by the `AddLeaveCommandParser` class which extends the `AddressbookParser`.

`AddLeaveCommandParser#parse()` overrides  `Parser#parse()` in the Parser interface.

`AddLeaveCommandParser` implements the following operations:

* `AddLeaveCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input arguments by storing the prefixes of its respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap`, and creates a new `AddLeaveCommand` object with the parsed employee ID, start date and end date.

The `AddLeaveCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the following methods:

* `Model#setEmployee(Employee, Employee)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the employee in the existing employee list to the new `Employee` object which has been edited by `AddLeaveCommand#execute()`.
* `Model#updateFilteredEmployeeList(Predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the view of the application to show all employees.

The method `AddLeaveCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The diagram below details how the operation of adding leave date(s) works.

![Add Leave Sequence Diagram](images/uml-diagrams/AddLeaveSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `addleave id/EMPLOYEE_ID from/START_DATE to/END_DATE` command in the CLI.
* `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are inputs of format `yyyy-MM-dd`.

**Step 3**: A leave period will be assigned to the employee specified with the employee ID input.
* The leave period is added as a list of `Leave` dates in the Employee's `leaveList`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Model-Employee Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Utilise `model#setEmployee` to add the edited employee into the model, doing the direct editing in AddLeaveCommand#execute().
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Potentially violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

* **Alternative 2**: Create methods in model specifically to edit the `leaveList` attribute of the employee.
    * Pros: More OOP, follows the Single Responsibility Principle by not having `AddLeaveCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requires more parts to work together.

### Delete Leave feature

**Step 2**: The user executes the `deleteleave id/EMPLOYEE_ID from/START_DATE to/END_DATE` command in the CLI.
* `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` are inputs of format `yyyy-MM-dd`.

**Step 3**: Leave appointments that fall between the start and end dates will be deleted from the employee specified with the employee ID input.
* If no leave appointments exist between the start and end dates, an error will be produced and shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the delete leave command:

![Delete Leave Activity Diagram](images/DeleteLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

    * Pros: More OOP, follows SRP by not having `DeleteRemarkCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requires more parts to work together.

### List Leave feature

The list leave feature allows HouR user to view employees on leave on the specified date.

* `Model#setEmployee(Employee, Employee)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the employee in the existing employee list to the new `Employee` object which has been edited by `DeleteRemarkCommand#execute()`.
* `Model#updateFilteredEmployeeList(Predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the view of the application to show all employees.

The method `DeleteRemarkCommand#execute()` returns a new `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the delete remark operation works:

![Delete Remark Sequence Diagram](images/DeleteRemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command:

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `deleteremark id/EMPLOYEE_ID r/REMARK` command in the CLI.

**Step 3**: The given remark will be deleted from the remark list of the employee with the given ID.

**Aspect: Model-Employee Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Utilise `model#setEmployee` to add the edited employee into the model, doing the direct editing in `DeleteRemarkCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Potentially violates SRP.

* **Alternative 2**: Create methods in model specifically to edit the `remarkList` attribute of the employee.
    * Pros: More OOP, follows SRP by not having `DeleteRemarkCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requires more parts to work together.

### Overtime feature

The overtime feature allows HouR users to manage employee overtime hours.

#### Implementation

The overtime command mechanism is facilitated by `OvertimeCommandParser` class which implements the `Parser` interface.

`OvertimeCommandParser#parse()` is exposed in the `Parser` interface as `Parse#parse()`.

`OvertimeCommandParser` implements the following operations:

* `OvertimeCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input arguments by storing the index and the prefix of its
respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap`, and creates a new `OvertimeCommand` object with the parsed id and overtime
hours.

The `OvertimeCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the following methods:

* `Model#setEmployee(Employee, Employee)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the employee in the existing employee list to the new `Employee`
object which has been edited by `OvertimeCommand#execute()`.

The method `OvertimeCommand#execute()` returns a new `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the
completion of the command.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the overtime operation works:

![Overtime Sequence Diagram](images/OvertimeSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command:

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `overtime id/EMPLOYEE_ID o/OPERATION a/AMOUNT` command in the CLI.
* `OPERATION` is either `inc` or `dec`.
* 
**Step 3**: The given overtime hours will be added to the employee with the provided ID.

**Aspect: Model-Employee Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Utilise `model#setEmployee` to add the edited employee into the model, doing the
direct editing in `OvertimeCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: More code reuse. Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Potentially violates SRP.

* **Alternative 2**: Create methods in model specifically to edit the `overtimeHours` attribute of the employee.
    * Pros: More OOP, follows SRP by not having `OvertimeCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.
    * Cons: More code duplication. Longer command execution, requires more parts to work together.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the overtime command:

### Report feature

#### Implementation

The proposed reporting mechanism is facilitated by `ReportCommandParser`. It implements the following operations:

* `ReportCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input employee ID and creates a new `ReportCommand` object with the parsed employee ID.

The `ReportCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` and `ReportStorage` APIs by calling the following methods:

* `Model#getFilteredEmployeeList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Gets the existing employee list, which is then looped through to get the employee with the given employee ID.

* `ReportStorage#saveReport(Report)`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the report generated in `ReportCommand#execute()` by `ReportCommand#generateReport(employee)`, which is then stored on the hard disk as a `.txt` file.

The method `ReportCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the report operation works:

![Report Sequence Diagram](images/ReportSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command:

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `report EMPLOYEE_ID` command in the CLI.

**Step 3**: A report will be generated for the employee with the given ID.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the report command:

![Report Activity Diagram](images/ReportActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Command-Model Interaction**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilise `Model#getFilteredEmployeeList()` to get the existing employee list, which is then looped through to get the employee with the given employee ID.
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requiring more parts to work together.

* **Alternative 2:** Create methods in `Model` class specifically to get the employee with the given employee ID.
    * Pros: Shorter command execution.
    * Cons: May reduce immutability between Employee and Model classes.

**Aspect: Command-Storage Interaction**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilise a dedicated storage class `ReportStorage` with the method `ReportStorage#saveReport(Report)` to save the report.
    * Pros: Maintain SRP and SLAP within the command class.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requiring more parts to work together.

* **Alternative 2:** Create methods in `ReportCommand` class to write and save the report.
    * Pros: Shorter command execution, one less point of failure by eliminating the `ReportStorage` class.
    * Cons: Less OOP, may violate SLAP within the command class.

### Reset feature

The reset feature allows HouR to reset employee overtime hours and leaves.

#### Implementation

The reset command mechanism is facilitated by `ResetCommandParser` class which implements the `Parser` interface.

`ResetCommandParser#parse()` is exposed in the `Parser` interface as `Parse#parse()`.

`ResetCommandParser` implements the following operations:
* `ResetCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses the input arguments by storing the index and the prefix of its respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap`,
and creates a new `ResetCommand` object with the parsed field.

The `ResetCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API by calling the following methods:
* `Model#setEmployee(Employee, Employee)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the employee in the existing employee list to the new `Employee` object which has been edited by `ResetCommand#execute()`.
* `Model#updateFilteredEmployeeList(Predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the view of the application to show all employees.

The method `ResetCommand#execute()` returns a new `CommandResult` object, which stores information about the completion of the command.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the reset operation works:

![Reset Sequence Diagram](images/ResetSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command:

**Step 1**: The user launches the application.

**Step 2**: The user executes the `reset f/FIELD` command in the CLI (note that only `overtime` and `leaves` are valid).

**Step 3**: The given field of all employees in the employee book will be reset to their default value.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the reset command:

![Reset Activity Diagram](images/ResetActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Model-Employee Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilise `Model#setEmployee` to add the edited employee into the model, doing the direct editing in `ResetCommand#execute()`.
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Employee and Model classes.
    * Cons: Potentially violates SRP.

* **Alternative 2:** Create methods in `Model` class specifically to edit the fields of the employees.
    * Pros: More OOP, follows SRP by not having `ResetCommand#execute()` perform the editing directly.
    * Cons: Longer command execution, requiring more parts to work together.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete EID1234-5678` command to delete an employee in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete EID1234-5678` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png" width="500" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new employee. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png" width="500" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Efforts**

This section documents the efforts that went into the development of this project, as well as the challenges faced.

### Difficulty Level and Challenges Faced

We would rate the difficulty level of this project as **Ï€/5**.

This is because the project codebase and architecture were initially quite challenging to understand, and we had to spend a significant amount of time tracing through the code and understanding how the different components of the project interacted with each other. However, once we understood the architecture of the project, it was relatively straightforward to add most of the new features and modify existing features.

The initial use of a forking workflow was extremely tedious and time-consuming, with lots of merge conflicts, slowing down our progress. However, we decided to switch over to a branching workflow, increasing our productivity and efficiency when delivering v1.3 and v1.4.

There were a few challenging features, such as the `sort` command, which required us to modify the code at multiple layers of abstraction, and the `report` command, which was one of the few commands that required its own storage class and methods. However, we were able to implement these features successfully after some effort.

Writing our own tests as well as modifying existing tests, while not particularly difficult, was quite time-consuming, and required us to spend a significant amount of time understanding the existing tests and how they worked.

Finally, writing documentation was a novel experience to us, and necessitated both a deep understanding of the codebase and a good grasp of documentation best practices. Making UML diagrams for the documentation was a particular challenge because of our inexperience with coding in UML. However, after writing the documentation for a few methods, the rest were relatively straightforward to write.

Given the challenges we faced and the novelty of some parts of the project, we would rate the difficulty level of this project as **Ï€/5**.

### Effort Required
In the project, we invested a moderate level of effort to ensure the successful development and delivery of our product. Here are some of the different aspects of our team efforts:

* **Group Effort**

Collaborative discussions have been held weekly to brainstorm ideas, plan sprints, and address challenges. We had discussed and assigned roles to every team member such that we could diligently contribute our own skills and expertise, striking a balance between efficiency and thoroughness. We also try out best to help each other when we can, especially since we understand that not every teammate is able to deliver as much due to other commitments.

* **Project Management**

Code reviews and testing processes have been carried out meticulously to maintain code quality and identify potential issues early on. We also demonstrated a commitment to meeting project milestones and deadlines, always having mid-week reminders of the tasks we have to complete and always assigning an earlier internal deadline to give as leeway to check before the actual submission.

### Achievements of the Project
This project has been a very invaluable experience where we got to have a taste of how actual software engineering projects wereâ€‰â€”â€‰exploring different types of workflows, different types of testing, etc. 

One of the things that we are most proud of is the bettering of the UI. Though the change was not very extravagant, the change in colour scheme was a feat in itself since we honestly did not aim to care a lot about our UI. We also managed to add icons beside the employee attributes in each employee card which we believe made it more readable for the users.

Another feature we are proud of is our `report` feature that allows our users to generate reports as txt files for each employee. While it might not contain a lot of information yet, we believe that it was a great starting point considering the time-constraint we had for this project, and we plan to extend and further develop this feature, improving the experience for our users.

Overall, we are proud of our project, and we believe that we have done our best with all the constraints and challenges we faced. We are happy with the result and believe that our product will meet the needs of our target audience.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Remark not shown in GUI employee list

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, the remark is not displayed on the employee list in GUI. 
* Users have to use report command to display employee remarks in message box.

**Solution:**
* We will update the employee card in the GUI to display remarks of the employees upon clicking on it.
* This is to ensure the displayed employee card is not cluttered with too much information.

### Deleting a remark requires typing the whole remark

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, deleting a remark requires the user to type in the remark exactly as it is
  typed in when added, i.e. exactly as it is shown in the message box.
* This can be tedious, especially for long remarks.

**Solution:**
* A solution is to address a remark by its index (based on date added) instead of its value, so that
  `deleteremark id/EMPLOYEE_ID 1` is enough to delete the first remark of employee with
  employee ID EMPLOYEE_ID.

### Adding a leave with a date far in the past and future

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, users are able to add a leave for an employee with date that is too far in the past
  and in the future, such as `1111-11-11` and `2222-12-12`.
* While users should be able to add a past and future dates as leaves for record keeping purposes,
  we see that being able to input a date this extreme is excessive and highly unrealistic.

**Solution:**
* We will enhance the leave list so that there are three separate lists, one for the current year, one for the previous year, and one for the following year.
* Users will only be allowed to add leave dates that fall within the time period of the beginning of the previous year to the end of the following year,
  and the number of annual leaves allocated will be calculated accordingly.
* For example, users will be able to add leave dates that fall in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Leaves taken in each year will be tracked separately.

### No efficient way to view a specific employee's leave dates

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, users can only view which employees are on leave on specific dates using `listleave` command.
  There is currently no specific command that allows users to view leave dates taken by a specific employee.
* The list of an employee's leave date can only be displayed when a user adds, edits, or deletes a leave date of that employee.

**Solution:**
* A possible solution is to display the leaves taken by an employee when the user executes a report command on the employee.

### Two employees are allowed to have the same phone number or email

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, adding an employee with the same phone number or email as another existing employee is allowed.
* This is caused by our decision to only check same employee by comparing by employee ID.
* This might lead to unintended duplicates.

Solution:
* We will update the check for the same employee to check not only by employee ID but also by phone number and email.

### Unable to view the number of leaves remaining when adding a leave period that exceeds maximum number of leaves

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, if a user tries to add a leave for an employee but that exceeds the maximum number of allowed employee leaves,
  the app only displays an error message telling the user it exceeds the remaining number of leaves.
* However, the app does not show the remaining number of leaves, so the fastest method is to use report command to display the current amount of
  leaves taken by the employee and perform manual subtraction to obtain remaining number of leaves.

**Solution:**
* We plan to revamp the error messages pertaining to this issue to display as much information as possible to the user, 
  in this case the remaining number of leaves.
* In this case, it is to change the error message into this:<br>
  `This leave period exceeds the number of leaves remaining for this employee`<br>
  `Number of leaves remaining: 1`

### Unable to view the number of overtime hours remaining when updating overtime hours that exceeds the range of allowed number of overtime hours

Problem:
* In our current implementation, if a user tries to update the number of overtime hours for an employee and exceeds the
  maximum number of allowed overtime hours or make it fall below zero, the app only displays an error message
  telling the user it exceeds the range of allowed number of overtime hours.
* However, the app does not show the remaining number of overtime hours, so the fastest method is to use report command to display the current amount of
  overtime hours taken by the employee and perform manual subtraction to obtain remaining number of overtime hours.

Solution:
* We plan to revamp the error messages pertaining to this issue to display as much information as possible to the user,
  in this case the remaining number of overtime hours.
* In this case, it is to change the error message into this:<br>
  `Number of overtime hours should not be above 72 or below 0`<br>
  `Number of overtime hours remaining: 2`

### Unclear error message for invalid email address

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, when a user keys in an invalid email address, the error message shown is very long and slightly inconsistent.
* This will highly confuse users who have very complex email addresses and keys the wrong email address by mistake.

**Solution:**
* We intend to keep error messages as short but as unambiguous as possible, so that users are able to identify
  their misinputs and fix them accordingly.
* In this case, it is to shorten the email error message into this:<br>
  `Emails should be of the format local-part@domain-name and adhere to the following constraints:`<br>
  `1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric , +, _, ., or - characters.
   The local-part must not start or end with any special characters.`<br>
  `2. The domain-name is made up of domain labels separated by either hyphens or periods. The domain name must:`<br>
     `- end with a domain label at least 2 characters long.`<br>
     `- have each domain label contain only alphanumeric characters.`<br>

### Edit command error message is inconsistent with respect to invalid ID

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, when a user inputs an invalid index in an edit command, the error messages
  differ with different user inputs.
* If index is less than one, i.e. 0 and below, the error message indicates an invalid command format due to the parser
  checking if index is less than one.
* If index is more than number of employees currently displayed, the error message only indicates an invalid index due to the
  command class being the one checking if index is too high.
* This inconsistency between error messages on the same issue can be confusing for users.

**Solution:**
* We plan to let the command class take care of determining whether an index is invalid or not while the parser class
  only needs to check if index is an integer.
* This will establish consistency when a user inputs a wrong index regardless if it's below one or above current number
  of employees displayed.
* It will still keep the invalid command format error message if index input is not an integer.

### Inconsistent arrangement of leaves in the leave list

**Problem:**
* In our current implementation, the leaves in the leave list shown in the result display are sorted according to when they were added to the employee.
* Moreover, editing a leave date replaces the previous date with the new date, rather than deleting the previous date and adding the new date to the end of the leave list.
* Such inconsistency can be confusing for users, and the current arrangement might lead to trouble finding specific leave dates in a long list of dates.

**Solution:**
* We plan to standardise the arrangement of the leave dates, such that they are sorted in chronological order.
* After any command that changes the leave list (e.g. `addleave`, `editleave`), the leave list will be re-sorted,
  with the earliest date at the top of the list and the latest date at the end of the list.
* This will reduce any inconsistencies, and make finding specific leave dates easier for users.
