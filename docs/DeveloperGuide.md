### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the app.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

(Remark: The overlapping triangles into `UiPart` are all class inheritance triangles (limitation of PlantUML).)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` object residing in the `Model`.

The `CommandBox` part keeps a reference to a `CommandBoxHistory` object, which stores the history of entered commands, allowing for the functionality of navigating to previous commands using the up/down arrow keys within the `CommandBox`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1 3 5")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1 3 5` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `InputParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InputParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InputParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the contacts data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `Settings` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlySettings` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/swe/context/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both contacts data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ContactsStorage` and `SettingsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `swe.context.commons` package.

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

The add feature is facilitated by `ModelManager` and implements `Model`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

It adds an contact by calling `Model#addContact`, which adds the newly created contact into the `UniqueContactList`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

### Filter feature

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter command works:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

It filters contacts by calling `Model#setContactsFilter` with a `ContainsTagPredicate predicate` as argument, which sets the `predicate`
on the list of contacts in the `ModelManager`.

### Maintaining sorting while supporting filtering

The contact list is automatically kept in a constantly sorted state by leveraging `SortedList` from the JavaFX Collections library. Since the class works with `ObservableList`s, which the Model's `Contacts` also utilises, we are able to leverage this class more easily.

The Model obtains an unsorted, unmodifiable list from `Contacts` and wraps it in a `SortedList`. We specify an `AlphabeticalComparator` to define our own alphabetical sorting order, which takes capitalization into account. This facilitates the intended propagation of changes from the nested list to the sorted list.

For operability with the find and filter feature, this sorted list is further wrapped in a `FilteredList` to limit the scope of what the user sees as needed. A dummy filter `Predicate` which allows all contacts to pass is used as the default filter. It is this filtered list that the model stores in a field.

### Edit feature

The edit feature is facilitated by `ModelManager` and implements `Model`.

It is similar in implementation to the add feature,
except it edits a contact by calling `Model#updateContact`,
which replaces the old contact with the edited contact in the `UniqueContactList`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an edit command.

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)


### Navigating to previous commands

The feature of navigating between command history using the up/down arrow keys, is facilitated by `CommandBoxHistory`. `CommandBox` keeps a reference to a `CommandBoxHistory` object which stores the history of entered commands.

`CommandBoxHistory` stores a list of commands, which behaves externally as if its last element is always the empty string. This is so that the user can enter a new command when at the last position in the command history.

The following sequence diagram summarises what happens when the user presses the up arrow key to navigate to the previous command in history.

![CommandBoxHistorySequenceDiagram](images/CommandBoxHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

The behaviour is very similar when the user presses the down arrow key to navigate to the next command in history, so we omit the corresponding sequence diagram.

The following sequence diagram summarises what happens when the user successfully executes a new command, and this new command is stored in the command history.

![CommandBoxHistoryNewSequenceDiagram](images/CommandBoxHistoryNewSequenceDiagram.png)

The command is only stored in history if the execution of the command (by `CommandExecutor`) is successful. The position in history is also reset to the last position (empty string) using `CommandBoxHistory#resetPointer`.

## Appendix: Requirements

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: NUS SoC students, who:

- Can type fast and prefer typing
- Are reasonably comfortable with command-line inputs
- Wish to label contacts by category (e.g. professors, classmates from certain courses, friends)
- Have many different ways to reach their contacts (e.g. social media like Telegram/Discord, additional phone numbers like house phone)

**Value proposition**: Manage contacts quickly via text commands, with useful features relevant to SoC students.

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.
</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and place it into an empty folder

   1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the JAR file in, and use the `java -jar context.jar` command to run the app.

### Adding a new contact

1. Adding a contact with all fields

   1. Test case: `add n/John Doe p/12345678 e/john@example.com o/notes t/friend a/Telegram: johndoe`
      Expected: A new contact with the name "John Doe", phone number "12345678", email "john@example.com", a note "notes", tagged as "friend", and an alternate contact "Telegram: johndoe" is added to the list.

   1. Test case: `add n/Alice p/87654321 e/alice@example.com`
      Expected: A new contact with the name "Alice", phone number "87654321", and email "alice@example.com" is added. Optional fields are left blank.

   1. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add`, `add n/John Doe`, `add e/john@example.com`, `add n/John Doe p/12`<br>
      Expected: Error message indicating the correct format for the `add` command.

### Editing an existing contact

1. Editing a contact's name and email

   1. Prerequisites: Have at least one contact in the list.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 n/Jane Doe e/jane@example.com`
      Expected: The first contact in the list has its name changed to "Jane Doe" and email to "jane@example.com".

   1. Test case: `edit 1 t/`
      Expected: All of the existing tags of the first contact in the list are removed while other information of the contact remains unchanged.

   1. Test case: `edit 2 n/Bob`
      Expected: Error message indicating the correct format for the `edit` command.

   1. Other incorrect edit commands to try: `edit`, `edit x` (where x is larger than the number of contacts in ConText), `edit 1 n/`, `edit 1 e/`<br>
      Expected: Error message indicating the correct or valid usage of the `edit` command.

### Deleting a contact

1. Deleting a contact while all contacts are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all contacts using the `list` command. Multiple contacts in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No contact is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Test case: `delete 1 2 3`<br>
      Expected: First, second, and third contacts are deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contacts shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 1 1 2`<br>
      Expected: First and second contacts are deleted from the list without duplication. Details of the deleted contacts shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Filtering contacts by tag

1. Filtering contacts using a specific tag

   1. Test case: `filter friend`
      Expected: List all contacts tagged as "friend".

   1. Other incorrect filter commands to try: `filter`, `filter @#$%` (assuming no such tags)<br>
      Expected: Error message indicating the correct usage of the `filter` command or no contacts found message.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Test case: Navigate to the folder with the JAR file, and remove all files and subfolders except the JAR file. Relaunch the app.
      Expected: The app will launch normally, with sample contact data.

   1. Test case: Navigate to the folder with the JAR file, and make arbitrary changes to the `\data\contacts.json` file, so as to render it invalid. Relaunch the app.
      Expected: The app will launch normally, with an empty contact list. 

## Appendix: Planned enhancements

1. Currently, error messages displayed in ConText are generic.
For example, if a user enters a negative index, the error message `Invalid command format` is displayed, even if the command format is technically correct.
We plan to add more specific error messages for invalid indices (e.g. non-positive, too large, or does not exist in the list), to let the user know that the index itself is invalid, and why.

1. Currently, special characters such as `-` and `/` are not allowed in names, even though they could conceivably be part of a contact's legal name.
We plan to allow for special characters to be included in a contact's name.

1. Currently, the `find` command only allows for matching of full words.
For example, the input keyword `John` will not match the name `Johnny` stored in the list.
This may lead to unintended behaviour for some users. We plan to allow partial matches of contact names for `find`.

1. Currently, duplicate contacts are only detected by contacts having completely identical names, and not by other fields such as email address.
Although this is meant to remove ambiguity in duplicate detection, it may be counter-intuitive for some users.
We plan to include additional warning messages for the detection of duplicate contacts.
We will warn users if they are adding contacts with duplicate information, such as duplicate email address, or names which differ only by whitespace (in the middle).
The user can then confirm whether they would like the duplicate contact to go through, or whether they would like to make changes to the duplicate contact.

1. Currently, duplicate values for deletion indices, as well as parameters like `t/` and `a/`, get silently merged.
This is not outright rejected for the convenience of users.
However, users may have accidentally entered such duplicate values, which may result in the app's behaviour differing from users' expectations.
In such cases, we plan to display additional warning messages for commands like `add`, `edit`, and `delete`, so that users may check if their specifying of duplicate values is intentional.
Users may then press enter again to confirm the command's execution, or edit the command.

1. Currently, if no note (i.e. no `o/` parameter) is specified when adding a contact, the note's value defaults to being empty (`""`).
The UI accounts for empty notes by not taking up an extra line to display the empty note.
When users do specify a note, they may explicitly specify an empty note (i.e. `o/` with no value).
This is not outright rejected for the convenience of users, since empty notes are allowed.
However, users may have forgotten to specify a value for the note, which may result in the app's behaviour differing from users' expectations.
In such cases, we plan to display an additional warning message for commands like `add`, so that users may check if their specifying of empty notes is intentional.

1. Currently, users are allowed to enter very flexible phone number values.
The only validation requirement is that the phone number begins with 3 digits.
This allows users to use the feature as they wish.
For example, although the standard intended usage is for users to enter just the digits of a phone number (e.g. `98765432`), they are also allowed to enter a value such as `65432109 (office); 98765432 (mobile)`.
However, this flexibility may result in users accidentally entering invalid phone numbers, such as `9876p/5432`.
Therefore, if users enter a phone number that does not contain only 3-15 digits, we plan to display an additional warning message for commands like `add` and `edit`, so that users may check if their specifying of such a value is intentional.
Users may then press enter again to confirm the command's execution, or edit the command.
The added need to confirm non-standard phone numbers nudges users towards using the alternate contacts feature for additional phone numbers instead.

1. Currently, alternate contacts do not allow spaces in the "type" portion, and do not allow special characters such as `@` in the "username" portion.
We plan to allow spaces in the "type" portion for added flexibility.
We also plan to allow special characters in the "username" portion, by allowing username values which match existing phone number/email validation.
Similarly, we would also allow all phone numbers to optionally start with the special character `+` before the required digits.
