## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="1000"/>

In the class diagram above, it is showing the state where the `Finance` tab is selected.

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactsTab`, `FinanceTab`, `EventsTab`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Depending on the Tab currently selected by the user, the `MainWindow` will display the corresponding `PersonListPanel`, `FinanceListPanel` or `EventListPanel`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<box type="info" seamless>

In the future, we aim to be able to abstract out the Card, ListPanel, and Tab (UI) accordingly, to make adding tabs much easier and convenient.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component within a Tab:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="750"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.</br>
**Note:** This takes place within the ContactsTab. 

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. All three tabs have their own `Logic` objects. These `Logic` objects share the same `Model` and `Storage`, but have different `Parsers`
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to that Tab's `Parser` (e.g. in our class diagram above the `ContactParser` receives the command). 
1. This parser then creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteContactCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the respective Parsers (i.e. `ContactParser`, `FinanceParser`, `EventParser`) class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddEventCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the `ContactParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
  * `DateTimeParser` is included here to show all Parser Classes. However, only a few Command Parsers interact with the `DateTimeParser` (when date-time inputs are involved).
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteFinanceCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data, event book data and finance book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable i.e., `ObservableList<Person>` where `Person` objects can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. This is the same for `Event` and `Finance`.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other seven components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below.


**For AddressBook:**

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagramAddressBook.puml" width="450" />

**For EventsBook:** note that multiple `Person` objects are can be associated to an Event as clients

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagramEventsBook.puml" width="450" />

**For FinanceBook:**

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagramFinancesBook.puml" width="450" />


</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="1000" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save the following data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
  * address book data
  * events book data
  * finance book data
  * user preference data
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `EventsBookStorage`, `FinanceBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* Both `EventsBook` and `FinanceBook` might contain Persons from the `AddressBook` (only upon creation)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Finance feature

In FreelanceBuddy, the creation of Finance entries (commissions and expenses) includes validation for clients. In the case that the user attempts to create a Finance entry with an associated client, FreelanceBuddy will check if the client exists in the Contacts Tab and only create the entry if it does.

Both `Commission` and `Expense` classes have the same attributes as `Finance` (as a result of inheritance), while both `AddCommissionCommand` and `AddExpenseCommand` classes handle the validation in similar ways. Hence, for simplicity, we will only discuss how a `Commission` is added to the `Model`, as the implementation is similar for Expense.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** We assume that a client named `John` already exists in the Contacts Tab. The user attempts to create a new Commission from `John Doe`, with the amount `20` and the description `Chatbot`.
He enters the command `add-c c/John a/20 d/Chatbot` in the Finance Tab. The `LogicManager` passes this to the `FinanceParser`, which identifies it as a command to add a commission. Then it creates a `AddCommissionCommandParser` and calls the `AddCommissionCommandParser#parse()` method.

<puml src="diagrams/AddFinanceSequenceDiagram1.puml" alt="AddFinanceSequenceDiagram1" />

**Step 2.** The `AddCommissionCommandParser` parses the given command into an `AddCommissionCommand` with a `Commission` that contains the following attributes: `Amount` containing `20`, `Description` containing `Chatbot`, `TimeDue` containing the time of creation (by default), and most notably, a **dummy** `Person` object containing placeholder values for all its attributes other than the name which is `John Doe`.
This dummy `Person` object is important as it allows us to fetch the **actual** `Person` object from the `Model` later on.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Only the instantiation of the dummy `Person` object is included in the diagram.

</box>

<puml src="diagrams/AddFinanceSequenceDiagram2.puml" alt="AddFinanceSequenceDiagram2" />

**Step 3.** The `LogicManager` then calls `AddCommissionCommand#execute()`. If the client exists (this is always the case for `Commission`), it will call the `Model#isValidClient()` method to check if the client exists in `Model`. If it does not, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

**Step 4.** Having verified that the client exists in `Model`, `AddCommissionCommand` then calls the `Model#getMatchedClient()` method to fetch the actual `Client` object in `Model`. This `Client` field in the `Commission` is then set to this actual `Client`.

**Step 5.** Lastly, the `Commission` in `AddCommissionCommand` is added to the `Model`, while returning a `CommandResult` with the details of the `Commission` formatted into a result `String`. This result `String` is then printed in the status box.

<puml src="diagrams/AddFinanceSequenceDiagram3.puml" alt="AddFinanceSequenceDiagram3" /> 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filtering Lists

In FreelanceBuddy, we have multiple commands that make use of a `Predicate` to filter the lists. </br>
(e.g. `filter-c`, `filter-t`, `summary`...) 

In this example, we will use the `summary` command from the finance tab to demonstrate how FreelanceBuddy 
uses a `Predicate` to update a `FilteredList` in the `Model`. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** We assume that the finance tab is already populated with finances from multiple clients. The user now wants to 
generate a summary report for the client `John Doe`. He enters the command `summary John Doe` into the command line. 

**Step 2.** A `ClientNameExactMatchPredicate` is created with the argument `"John Doe"`. This predicate will be used to
filter the `financeList` later on.

<puml src="diagrams/SummarySequenceDiagram1.puml" alt="SummarySequenceDiagram1" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The activation bar of the LogicManager continues to the next diagram.

</box>

**Step 3.** `SummaryCommand` is then executed by the `LogicManager`. The model updates the `financeList` with the given
`namePredicate` (i.e. `ClientNameExactMatchPredicate("John Doe")`). The `filteredFinances` list is then fetched from the model.

**Step 4.** With the `filteredFinances`, we then call the static `FinanceSummary#generateSummary` method to create a summary
report. The method returns the summary as a string which is then passed as an argument into the `CommandResult` constructor.

<puml src="diagrams/SummarySequenceDiagram2.puml" alt="SummarySequenceDiagram2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The activation bar of the LogicManager continues from the previous diagram.

</box>

**Step 5.** The summary report is then displayed in the status box. The list of finances displayed in the finance tab will
also update to only show finances related to the given client. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Changing Tabs

Use of the `tab` command to switch between tabs in the UI. 

Currently, the application uses the existing [TabPane from JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/TabPane.html), and it makes use of the tab index to switch tabs. 

#### Tab object

The `commons.core.Tab` object stores both the index and tab name. It also contains the standard index and tab name constants of each tab which can be used by other classes.

<box type= "tip" seamless>

You will need to update these constants in `commons.core.Tab` if you wish to add/edit/delete a tab from the application. 
</box>

To create the `Tab` object, you need to use the `Tab#fromParameter("tabName")` as the constructor is private.
Note that the `Tab` object will convert and store the index based on the given tab name(assuming it is valid).

<box type= "warning" seamless>

Note that `ui.ContactsTab`, `ui.EventsTab` and `ui.FinanceTab` does not implement from `core.tab.Tab` as they have different purposes.
</box>

#### Usage scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tab mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application, and is on the contacts tab.  

**Step 2.** The _user executes_ `tab events` command to switch from the contacts tab to the events tab.
The `TabCommandParser` creates the `Tab` object using the `ParserUtil#parseTab("events")` method.

**Step 3.** The method _checks if it is a valid input_ using `Tab#isValidParameter("events")` **before** creating the `Tab` object.

**Step 4.** The `Tab` object _converts the given parameter into the appropriate tab index_, and stores both the parameter and index within the object. 
The `Tab` object is passed from the `TabCommandParser` to the `TabCommand`, 
which returns the tab index from the `Tab` object using `Tab#getZeroBasedTabIndex()`.

In this case, the return value is 2 since the index for the Events Tab is 2. 

**Step 5.** The `ContactsTab` switches tab in the GUI using the `ContactsTab#handleTabChange(2)`

The following sequence diagram represents the user is changing from the Contacts tab to the Events tab as mentioned above.

<puml src="diagrams/ChangeTabSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ChangeTabSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarise what happens when a user changes a tab.

<puml src="diagrams/TabActivityDiagram.puml" alt="TabActivityDiagram" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Date-time Parsing

Other than the basic understanding of how the Date-time inputs are determined, the rules and assumptions it has. [Read here for more info: Accepted Date-time Formats](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w09-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#accepted-date-time-formats).
It would be important to understand the inner-workings of the date-time parser to appreciate certain design choices made when implementing features.

#### Motivations Behind the Design

The choice to implement a more advanced date-time parser than what is available in the Java `LocalDateTime` library or other external libraries is:
1. **Convenient** and **faster** input of date-time input.
2. **More conventional** date-time formats (akin to verbal communication)
3. **Smarter** date-time parser that helps **predict** dates or time that are *usually* assumed.
4. date-time parser that is **fast** and **lean** – does not require unnecessarily long inputs from user that may be ambiguous.

##### Accepting More `DateTimeFormatter` Formats

First, we start off by accepting more formats of `Date` and `Time` that Java's `LocalDateTime` library provides (Numbered Date-time formats). All summarised in the [User Guide](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w09-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#accepted-date-time-formats).

Parsing for this is done by "brute force" handled by the number of elements the date-time format has (the reason it is done this way will be explained in a later section):

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

To illustrate how parsing of multiple formats is done, the sequence diagram shows `parseTwoElementsNumberTimeFormat()`, one of the methods that parses multiple formats, and how it matches the input with a format and parses it:

<puml src="diagrams/ExampleParsingNumberFormats.puml" alt="ExampleParsingNumberFormats" />

In words:
1. `DateTimeParser` will call the relevant `private static` method to parse the respective input (in this case `parseTwoElementsNumberTimeFormat()`)
2. It will check if the input is of the right length. (Omitted above as it is not as important).
3. For this particular example, there are 3 formats of `LocalTime`, the program will loop through each format. (`h a`, `h:mm a` and `h.mm a`)
4. A `DateTimeFormatter` is built to be case-insensitive, with the format at that point of execution and to language English (relevant to formats that have letters).
5. `LocalTime.parse()` is called with the `DateTimeFormatter` and the program attempts to parse the input with the specified format.
6. If parse is successful, a `LocalTime` instance is returned.
7. Else, the program catches the exception and continues.
8. If nothing is returned after all formats have been looped through, the method returns `null` to indicate a failed parse.

This method is repeated with the other Numbered Time and Numbered Date formats. 

> Of note as well, is the formats that do not contain year inputs e.g. `d/M`, `d MMM`, etc. In these cases, the year will be set to the current year that the method is called.
> This is done with building the `DateTimeFormatter` with the year using method `parseDefaulting(ChronoField.YEAR, getToday().getYear())`

With this, this will enable date-time inputs to be **faster** and **more convenient** as users have a wide variety of formats to choose from.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Accepting More Formats - Natural Language

Another feature we wanted to achieve is for users to use natural language formats that maybe not be as easily expressed in a date or a time.
Formats that are usually used when conversing. As there are a lot of possibilities it is impossible to accept all forms, we had to sieve out several more important formats that Freelancers may use more often.

**Common references of time**: noon, midnight, in _ minutes.

**Common references of dates**: tomorrow, next week, next Monday, in _ weeks.

**Common references that imply both date and time**: now, _ from now.

These make sense as scheduling meetings with a client may sound like: *"Let's follow-up next week, 4:30pm?"*

Similarly, we can achieve this by parsing these inputs based on the number of words it has. For natural language formats as you can see from the [User Guide](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w09-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#accepted-date-time-formats),
has formats that correspond to the number of words (For example, 3 word date formats are in the formt of "in _ days/months/years"). Hence, we parsed these inputs using switch cases.

To explain, we have described the implementation of one of methods that parse english date time formats, `parseThreeElementsEnglishDateFormat()` in the activity diagram below:

<puml src="diagrams/EnglishFormatsParsingActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ParsingAD" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Parsing Date-Time Instance

Now we have built the base of how to parse Date, Time and Date Time inputs (both Numbered and Natural Language formats) by their elements. We need a master method to pull all these together. 
Given a string, how does the program choose the right kind of methods to parse the input?

The `parseDateTimeInstance()` method brings together all of this to parse any given string.

To demonstrate how a string is parsed into a `LocalDateTime` value given that it can be any combination of `Date`, `Time` or `DateTime` formats. We use the below activity diagram to demonstrate:

<puml src="diagrams/ParseDateTimeInstanceAD.puml" alt="DTIAD" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

To further explain what happens within a "Parse X Inputs" we take a look at one of the implementations, `parseThreeElements`.

<puml src="diagrams/ParseThreeElementsAD.puml" alt="ParseThreeElementsActivityDiagram" width="600"/>

As you can see this is how given the number of words of input, date-time can be parsed even if input can be a date, time or date-time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**On a higher level, a general flow will look something like this:** (note that this is greatly simplified)

<puml src="diagrams/InstanceDateTimeHighLevel.puml" alt="InstanceDateTimeHighLevel" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

##### Parsing Smartly

In one the above diagram where we talked about `parseThreeElements()` we got a glimpse of how the parser parses date-time inputs smartly.

In the event either the date or time is not specified, the parser will assume with a "future-bias" prediction on the unspecified date or time.

For example, when time is not specified, it will be set to the 00:00, signifying the start of the day. Likewise, if the date is not specified, the next occurrence of the date with the specified time will be chosen.

****Parsing Durations****

This is further shown when parsing durations using `parseDateTimeDuration()` 
1. When parsing `<TIME>` to `<TIME>` only durations, date will be set to next occurrence of the end time. (Future-Bias assumptions)
2. When parsing `<DATE>` to `<DATE>` only durations, time will be set from 00:00 for start date and 23:59 for end date. (Assuming whole day durations)
3. When parsing `<DATE><TIME>` to `<TIME>`, time will be assumed to be the same date as the start `<DATE>`. (Conventional way of communicating e.g. Next Monday 4-6pm)

For more information on the assumptions that the parser makes when there are missing `<DATE>` or `<TIME>` inputs for either start or end time, you can check out the User guide section for this [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w09-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#accepted-date-time-combinations-of-s-and-e).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Planned Enhancements**

In this section, we will go through some current Feature Flaws that FreelanceBuddy currently has and our plans to fix it.

#### 1. Lack of cross-tab updating

Currently, when a user deletes or edits a client in the contacts tab, this change is not reflected in the Finance and Events
tabs. For example, when the client `John Doe` is deleted from our contacts tab, Finances and Events that were previously tagged
with the client `John Doe` will remain unaffected. The user will have to manually change the entries in the Finance and Events
tab to reflect the necessary changes. 

We plan on making the edits and deletes from the contacts tab cascade to the other tabs. This will ensure that changes made
in the contacts tab will be reflected in the other two tabs, avoiding any potential confusion. 

#### 2. Missing client validation when loading from storage

Currently, we do not perform any client validation checks on data that is being loaded in from the json files. For example, 
if the user decides to edit a Finance entry from the json files, they will be able to change the tagged client to a client 
that does not exist in their contacts.

We plan on adding an extra layer of client validation checks for when data is being loaded in from the storage. This will
help to ensure that the data remains consistent even if the user decides to manually change the json files. 

#### 3. Missing protection for preferences and config json files

Currently, if user changes the values in the `preferences.json` or `config.json` files to an illegal value, this will cause 
the application to not be able to start. For example, if the user changes the `userPrefsFilePath` value in the `config.json`
file to `null`, the application will not be able to start. 

We plan on handling this issue by resetting the files to their default values if an invalid input is detected. This will
prevent a scenario where the user is unable to launch the app.

#### 4. Duplicates of contact names

Currently, the system allows duplicate contact names due to case sensitivity,
which is inconsistent with real-world scenarios where case sensitivity isn't considered.

We plan to implement a case-insensitive check for contact names to prevent duplicate entries.
Freelancebuddy will recognize "John" and "john" as the same entry, ensuring uniqueness irrespective of case,
preventing the addition of duplicates names based solely on case variation.


#### 5. Duplicates of contact phone numbers
Currently, the system allows duplicate contact phone numbers
which is inconsistent with real-world scenarios where phone numbers are unique and tied to a single person.

We plan to implement a check for contact phone numbers to prevent duplicate entries, including phone numbers which include country codes
For example, `+6598765432` will be considered the same as `98765432`, where `+65` is the country code for Singapore.

#### 6. Duplicates of contact telegram names
Currently, the system allows duplicate telegram names
which is inconsistent with real-world scenarios where telegram names are unique and tied to a single person.

We plan to implement a check for telegram names to prevent duplicate entries.

## **Appendix: Effort**

This section aims to showcase the effort that we put into FreelanceBuddy as a team. We will highlight the challenges
and efforts we faced for each component of FreelanceBuddy.

With FreelanceBuddy, we added the `Finance` and `Event` entities on to the existing AB3 `Person` entity. 
These entities and their models were made from scratch, with minimal code reuse from AB3. 

With the addition of these entities, we felt that it made the most sense to create two new tabs. This meant that new UI 
components had to be created for each tab. For this, the main structure of each tab was somewhat similar to the original AB3 UI,
however slight adjustments were made to cater to the needs of each tab.

With the creation of three tabs, we realised that separate parsers had to be made. This is because the same command should
have a different result depending on which tab you are on. To achieve this, we made three new parsers - `ContactParser`,
`FinanceParser` and `EventParser` which all extend the `ParseCommandHandlers` class. This helped us to manage how commands
were handled in each tab. `ContactParser` was adapted from the original AB3 `AddressBookParser` while the other two parsers
had very minimal code reuse, due to the fact that they handled very different commands.

For the commands, many of the basic commands (i.e. add, delete and edit) that we added to `Finance` and `Events` made 
use of the existing AB3 commands. Many of the new commands we added (i.e. `filter-n`, `summary`) relied on the 
use of the `Predicate` classes. This was adapted from the existing `find` command of AB3. While the new commands were not exactly
the same as the `find` command, we were able to extract the idea of how to filter a list from the `find` command.

We also made an effort to cater to more intuitive user inputs through the implementation of the `DateTimeParser`. 
We felt that the addition of this `DateTimeParser` greatly improved the user experience since many of our commands made 
use of both a start and end time. The implementation of this was not trivial and none of the code for this was taken from AB3.

The main challenge we faced with FreelanceBuddy was that we were now handling three separate entity types, all of which had
different behaviours and functions. This made integration between the three tabs more challenging. As an example, we
were unable to implement the cascading update and delete from the `Contacts` tab to the `Finance` and `Events` tabs 
([more on this](#1-lack-of-cross-tab-updating)). 

Overall, we felt that we the effort that we have put into creating FreelanceBuddy is more than sufficient. This is justified
by the sheer amount of new features we have added (i.e. all the `Finance` and `Events` features). We also felt that many
of the features we added (e.g. `summary`, `filter-t`) were different from all the AB3 features.

### Loading data

<box type="tip" seamless>

**How to load data from a different file?**

Change the file location that you want the app to target through the `preferences.json` file. Make sure that it is a valid file path.
