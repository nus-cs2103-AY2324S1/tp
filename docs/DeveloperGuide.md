### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `ThemeProperty` object which represents the theme of the application.
* stores a `CommandStringStash` object which has the history of recently executed commands.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `modelManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.

`modelManagerStateList` contains a list of `ReadOnlyModelManager`

Each `ReadOnlyModelManager` contains : 
*  `addressBook`
*  `filteredPersons`
*  `userPrefs`
*  `selectedPerson`
*  `themeProperty`

Additionally, ModelManager implements the following operations:

* `ModelManager#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current ModelManager state in its history.
* `ModelManager#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous ModelManager state from its history.
* `ModelManager#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone ModelManager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized and `ModelManager#Commit` is called with the initial ModelManager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single ReadOnlyModelManager state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the current list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commit()`, causing the modified state of the ModelManager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `modelManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted ModelManager state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add -pa n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commit()`, causing another modified ModelManager state to be saved into the `ModelManagerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the ModelManager state will not be saved into the `ModelManagerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous ModelManager state, and restores the ModelManager to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ModelManager state, then there are no previous ModelManager states to restore. The `undo` command uses `ModelManager#hasHistory()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **note:** the lifeline for `undocommand` should end at the destroy marker (x) but due to a limitation of plantuml, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ModelManager to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `ModelManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest ModelManager state, then there are no undone ModelManager states to restore. The `redo` command uses `ModelManager#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list -pa`. Since this command modifies the ModelManager, `Model#commit()` is called.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `ModelManagerStateList`, all ModelManager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add -pa n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

<br>

### View Command Feature

The view command feature allows the user to view the details of a specific patient or specialist.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The List of person will be initialized with the initial
state, and the `Current Selected Person` pointer will be pointing to the first person on the list. <br>

![ViewState1](images/ViewState1.png)


Step 2. The user executes `view 2` to view the 2nd person's details in `DoConnek Pro`.
The `view` command updates the `Current Selected Person` pointer with the corresponding index from the
input. <br>

![ViewState2](images/ViewState2.png)


Step 3. The UI now updates the view panel to display the newly selected person and their details.

The sequence diagram below shows how the view operation works:
![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the view command:
![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

<br>

### Recall recent commands feature

The recent command feature is facilitated by the `CommandStringStash`. This is a stash that stores the history
of the command string of the 20 most recent commands executed. Internally, it is stored as a `cmdStringStack`,
and `currentCmdIndex`. This internal representation allows cycling through the recent commands both forwards
and backwards.

These operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#getPrevCommandString(String commandInputString)`,
`Logic#getPassedCommandString(String commandInputString)`, and `Logic#addCommandString(String commandInputString)`.

The following operations are implemented by the `CommandStringStash`:
* `CommandStringStash#addCommandString(String commandInputString)` - Adds `commandInputString` to the history.
* `CommandStringStash#getPrevCommandString(String commandInputString)` - Cycles one command further back in history.
* `CommandStringStash#getPassedCommandString(String commandInputString)` - Cycles one command further forward in history.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **note:** Cycling forwards or backwards may not always be
valid operations. No cycling forward or backward can be done if the stash is empty. No cycling backward
can be done if the user is already on the least recent command in the stash, and no cycling forward can be done
if the user has not yet cycled backward. To consider all these cases, the `commandInputString` is passed as a parameter
to `CommandStringStash#getPrevCommandString(String commandInputString)` and `CommandStringStash#getPassedCommandString(String commandInputString)`.
The `commandInputString` is the current command in the CLI textbox and is returned from these methods in the case of invalid operations
so that there is no change to the CLI textbox.

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the recall recent commands feature works at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandStringStash` will be initialised
with no command strings and a `currentCmdIndex` of 0.

![Recall Step 1](images/RecallStep1.png)

Step 2. The user executes the `list -sp` command to list the specialists in DoConnek Pro. Upon success,
`Logic#addCommandString("list -sp")` is called, adding this command string to the `CommandStringStash` and moving the
`currentCmdIndex` to point to right after the element added.

![Recall Step 2](images/RecallStep2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **note:** After `Logic#getPrevCommandString` is called,
the `currentCmdIndex` is set to point one index after the last element in the `CommandStringStash`. 
This 'resets' the state allowing the users to start to cycle back from the most recently added command again.
The `Logic#getPrevCommandString` method decrements the `currentCmdIndex` before returning the String allowing the mechanism to work as intended.

</div>

Step 3. The user executes two more commands `help` and `delete 1` in the respective order. As before, the
`CommandStringStash` is updated appropriately.

![Recall Step 3](images/RecallStep3.png)


Step 4. The user wants to list the patients in DoConnek Pro but forgot how to do so. They decide to execute the `help`
command. To do so efficiently, they press the up arrow on the keyboard to recall the `help` command they recently entered.
This results in `Logic#getPrevCommandString` being called which returns `delete 1`.  The user's CLI text box is then set to display `delete 1`.

![Recall Step 4](images/RecallStep4.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how this recalling of the previous command string works.

![Recall Command Sequence Diagram](images/RecallCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

To cycle forward in history, a similar sequence is followed, but `Logic#getPassedCommandString` and its
corresponding methods are called instead.

Step 5. The user presses the up arrow again, and this time `Logic#getPrevCommandString` returns `help` which is displayed
on the user's CL. They can now easily execute `help`.

![Recall Step 5](images/RecallStep5.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user presses the up arrow.

![Up Arrow Activity Diagram](images/UpArrowActivityDiagram.png)

Step 6. Instead of executing `help` the user decides to delete the first specialist currently displayed.
They press the down arrow on the keyboard to recall the `delete 1` command they just passed.
This results in `Logic#getPassedCommandString` being called which returns `delete 1`.  The user's CLI text box is then set to display `delete 1`.

![Recall Step 6](images/RecallStep6.png)

Step 7. The user now executes `delete 1`. As before, `Logic#addCommandString("delete 1")` is called,
adding this command string to the `CommandStringStash`. Since this command string already exists in the `CommandStringStash`,
the older version of it is purged from the stash.

![Recall Step 7](images/RecallStep7.png)

The following activity diagram summarises how the `CommandStringStash` is updated when a user executes a command.

![Add Command String](images/AddCommandStringActivityDiagram.png)

<br>

### Find feature

#### Overview
The find feature allows the user to find patients or specialists by checking whether their attributes contain certain keywords.
Upon entering a `find` command, an instance of `FindCommandParser` is created to process the prefixes along with their corresponding arguments into
predicates. The predicates are represented as `Predicate<Person>` (using Java's in-built functional interface), and are mapped
to their prefixes in a `FindPredicateMap`. A `FindPredicateMap` encapsulates **all** predicates indicated by the user,
which are later combined and used to test each `Person` in the `FilteredPersonList` of the `Model`.

As patients and specialists have common and differing attributes, so do their predicates.<br>
Predicates common to both:<br>
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `TagsContainsKeywordsPredicate`

Predicates unique to patients:<br>
`AgeContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `MedHistoryContainsKeywordsPredicate`

Predicates unique to specialist:<br>
`LocationContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `SpecialtyContainsKeywordsPredicate`

#### Example
The following sequence diagram shows how a find command is parsed and executed to find a patient.
In this example, the command entered is <br>
`find -pa n/Tim m/Anaemia`

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

When the `FindCommandParser` parses the prefix arguments, a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `MedHistoryContainsKeywordsPredicate`
is instantiated by their corresponding arguments and are mapped to their prefixes in the `FindPredicateMap`.

![FindPredicateMapExample](images/FindPredicateMapExample.png)

The predicates are combined into a single `Predicate<Person>` in `FindCommand#execute` and applied to each `Person` in the 
`FilteredPersonList` of the `Model`.

To find a specialist, a similar parse and execution flow is conducted. 

<br>

### Shortcut management feature

User defined shortcuts are managed by `ShortcutSettings`. Internally it contains a `shortcutMap` that stores _mappings_ of 
user defined _shortcut aliases_ to existing valid _command keywords_. This class provides functionality for registering new shortcuts,
removing previously defined shortcuts, and querying the map to check if a shortcut has previously been defined.

These shortcut mappings need to be updated by command execution, as well as used in parsing of user input. Thus, the following design decisions have been made:
1. Shortcut operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as 
   * `Model#registerShortcut(ShortcutAlias shortcutAlias, CommandWord commandWord)` 
   * `Model#removeShortcut(ShortcutAlias shortcutAlias)`
   * `Model#getShortcut(String alias)`
2. `AddressBookParser` now has a dependency to the `Model`. This is required so that the shortcut mappings can be accessed for use in parsing user input.

![Class Diagram](images/ShortcutSettingsClassDiagram.png)

Within `ShortcutSettings` similar operations are implemented to `register`, `remove`, and `get` shortcuts. Additionally to resolve bugs that might arise from users tampering with the `preferences.json` file,
`ShortcutSettings#removeBadMappings()` clears the `shortcutMap` of invalid mappings and is called on initialisation.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

#### Invalid Mappings
On this subject, in order to not jeopardise parsing operations and the user experience, some restrictions have been put on the mappings that can be registered. 
These restrictions are enforced by the wrapper class `ShortcutAlias`, along with the relevant method in `ParserUtil`.
1. Shortcut aliases must not be blank.
2. Shortcut aliases must only contain alphanumeric characters without any whitespaces.
3. Shortcut aliases must not match the default `COMMAND_WORD` of any existing commands.
   * This is to prevent any unintended behaviour, and users might even accidentally 'lock' themselves out of using certain commands if they are unaware of how to manipulate `preferences.json`.
</div>

#### Command execution
The sequence diagram below outlines the command execution of a sample `AddShortcutCommand` that wants to register `del` as a shortcut for `delete`.

![Add Shortcut Sequence](images/AddShortcutCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagrams summarise the process of adding and removing shortcuts from DoConnek Pro.

![Add Shortcut Activity](images/AddShortcutActivityDiagram.png)
![Delete Shortcut Activity](images/DeleteShortcutActivityDiagram.png)

#### Saving between sessions
`ShortcutSettings` implements the `Serializable` interface, thus is saved to `json` format as a part of `UserPrefs`. 

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How shortcuts are stored and accessed:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stored in a separate `ShortcutSettings` class.
    * Pros: Separation of responsibility and easier management.
    * Cons: More memory usage and introduces one dependency between `AddressBookParser` and `Model`.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows its own list of shortcuts.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (No extra data structure created).
    * Cons: Difficult to manage duplicate shortcut mappings.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
The target users...

* are management staff at a General Practitioner's Clinic
* need to keep track of the clinic's patients' details
* need to keep track of the affiliated specialists that the clinic refers patients to
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing to mouse interactions
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: A one-stop application that allows management of both a clinic's patient and specialist details faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Currently, the view panel can only be updated using the view command. 
However, we are planning on implementing a feature that will allow users to update the view panel by simply clicking on a person in the list panel.
This change is driven by our goal to enhance user experience: although our application primarily caters to CLI users, such  behaviour
still seems intuitive and reasonable to expect.

2. Currently, when the `delete` command encounters invalid indexes, it generates an error and does not delete any patient or specialist records.
In contrast, the `delsc` command handles invalid shortcuts by recognizing and ignoring them, while continuing to remove any valid shortcuts in the command.
The inconsistency between these two delete functions has been identified, and we have plans to address it in the future.
Our upcoming improvement will entail modifying the `delete` command to acknowledge and ignore invalid indexes while effectively deleting records specified by valid indexes provided by the user.

3. DoConnek Pro currently checks for duplicate persons by name. This means that people with the same names cannot be added even if they have different parameters (like `Phone` or `Email`). This
checking of duplicates is also case-sensitive, whereas names, in general, are not case-sensitive. To resolve these two problems concurrently,
we plan on implementing a `NRIC` field for patients and a `MCR` field for specialists as unique identifiers. 


4. DoConnek Pro currently disallows the use of "/" in a person name because it is used as a command delimiter.
Users may face problems due to this if they have to, for example, add a person with "s/o" in their name.
Future updates to the application plan to account for such cases.


5. DoConnek Pro is currently not intelligent enough to detect incorrect-but-close-enough flags. Users must enter the
commands in the exact format specified in the user guide. For example, even if users input `tag/` instead of `t/`, DoConnek
Pro will not accept this as a valid input format. In the future we plan to make DoConnek Pro more flexible in this regard.


6. DoConnek Pro allows users to add multiple entries for certain attributes, notably `MEDICAL_HISTORY` and `TAG`. However, 
it cannot guarantee the ordering of these entries as inputted by the user in the command line. 
We plan on rectifying DoConnek Pro to maintain this user-specified ordering in the future.
