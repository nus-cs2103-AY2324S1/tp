## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280"></puml>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574"></puml>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300"></puml>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"></puml>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `LeaveListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Leave` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"></puml>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the leaves book data as well i.e., all `Leaves` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueLeavesList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of `find`) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Leave` objects (e.g. results of `find-leave`) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Leave>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450"></puml>

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The `Storage` component,
* can save the address book data, leaves book data and user preference data in either JSON or CSV format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `LeavesBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<puml src="diagrams/AddressBookStorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>
<puml src="diagrams/LeavesBookStorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

Both `AddressBookStorage` and `LeavesBookStorage` contain JSON and CSV implementations. These implementations exist separately
as their methods invoke methods from different Util files - the JSON implementation invokes JsonUtil methods, while the
CSV implementation invokes CsvUtil methods. `SerializableAddressBook`, `SerializableLeavesBook`, `AdaptedPerson` and
`AdaptedLeave` have been abstracted out to promote code reusability, with the use of generics where possible to enforce
type safety.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### The Person class

ManageHR keeps track of employees within the company with the use of `Person` and `UniquePersonList`. The `UniquePersonList` serves as a container for the `Person` objects,
while enforcing the constraints that no 2 employees have the same name.

The `Person` class contains the following attributes.
<puml src="diagrams/EmployeeObjectDiagram.puml", width="550"></puml>

1. `Name`: The name of the employee.
2. `Phone`: The phone number of the employee.
3. `Email`: The email address of the employee.
4. `Address`: The address of the employee.
5. `Tags`: The customised tag added by the user.

### The Leave class

ManageHR keeps track of the leaves of employees within the company with the use of `Leave` and `UniqueLeaveList`. The `UniqueLeaveList` serves as a container for the `Leave` objects,
while enforcing the constraints that no 2 leaves can have same start date and end date for the same employee.

The `Leave` class contains the following attributes.
<puml src="diagrams/LeaveObjectDiagram.puml", width="550"></puml>

1. `ComparablePerson`: The employee.
2. `Title`: The title of the leave.
3. `Description`: The description of the leave.
4. `Date start`: The start date of the leave.
5. `Date end`: The end date of the leave.
5. `Status`: The status of the leave.

`Date start` must be earlier than or the same as the `Date end`.
All the attributes except Description and Status are compulsory fields for adding a leave.

### Add A Leave application feature

The add-leave command allows the HR manager to add a leave record for a specific employee. This feature enhances the HRMate system by providing a way to manage and track employee leaves efficiently.
Fields compulsory to enter for `add-leave` as `String` type include:
1. `index`: The index of the person for the leave application. It will be parsed as `Index` type to `AddLeaveCommand` object and converted to `Person` type based on the displayed list when a new `Leave` object created.
2. `title`: The title of the leave, it will be parsed as `Title` type to `AddLeaveCommand` object and to the newly created `Leave` object.
3. `date start`: The start date of the leave in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. It will be parsed together with `date end` as `Range` type to `AddLeaveCommand` object and to the newly created `Leave` object.
4. `date end`: The end date of the leave in "yyyy-MM-dd" format. It will be parsed together with `date start` as `Range` type to `AddLeaveCommand` object and to the newly created `Leave` object.
5. `description`: The description of the leave. It is optional and will be parsed as `NONE` if no description field exists. Otherwise it will be parsed as `Description` type to `AddLeaveCommand` object and to the newly created `Leave` object.

* CommandException due to unfounded index in the list will be thrown and handled in `AddLeaveCommand`.
* InvalidValueExceptions thrown due to illegal arguments, and EndBeforeStartExceptions thrown due to the end date occurring before the start date, will be handled by ParserException in `AddLeaveCommandParser`.
* CommandException due to duplicated leaves that have exact start and end dates will be thrown and handled at the line `model.addLeave(toAdd)` in `AddLeaveCommand#execute`.

The activity diagram for adding a leave is as followed:
<puml src="diagrams/AddLeaveCommandActivityDiagram.puml", width="550"></puml>

Here is an example usage of the `add-leave` feature:
1. The user uses the `find` command to filter for employees named Martin.
2. The user enters the command `add-leave 1 title/Sample Leave 1 start/2023-11-01 end/2023-11-01` with Martin being index 1.
3. A record of leave with specified title and dates for Martin is created.

#### Design considerations
The command follows a structured format to ensure ease of use and to minimize errors. The use of an index ensures that the leave is associated with a specific employee. The format of the command is designed to be clear and straightforward.

### Find an Employee by tags
`FindAllTagCommand` and `FindSomeTagCommand` are implemented similar to `FindCommand`.
They use `TagsContainAllTagsPredicate` and `TagsContainAllTagsPredicate` respectively as predicate to filter the employee list. And then update the displayed employee list of the model

The following sequence diagram shows how `FindAllTagCommand` executes.
<puml src="diagrams/FindAllTagCommandDiagram.puml", width="550"></puml>

#### Design considerations:
`FindAllTagCommand` matches employees with all specified tags while `FindSomeTagCommand` matches employees with any of the specified tags.
The nuance difference is made to cater to users' needs for efficient searching.

### Adding tag feature

#### Implementation
`AddTagCommand` is implemented similar to `EditCommand`.
A new `Person` is created with the information from the old `Person`.
The tags are then added before replacing the old `Person` with the new `Person`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddTagSequenceDiagram.puml", width="550"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How AddTagCommand executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Builts a new Person.
    * Pros: Easy to implement (using `EditCommand` as reference), immutability allows for potential redo and undo commands.
    * Cons: Memory intensive, costly in terms of time.
* **Alternative 2:** Add tags to `Person`.
    * Pros: Memory efficient
    * Cons: Mutable `Person` can affect implementation of potential redo and undo commands.

### Find leave by period feature

#### Implementation
`FindLeaveByPeriodCommand` is implemented similar to `FindCommand`. It uses a `LeaveInPeriodPredicate` as the predicate to filter
the leaves list. 

The predicate can be in 1 of 4 possible states
* Return true for all leaves - no start and end date is supplied for the query
* Return true for all leaves with at least one day in the period [start, end] inclusive - both start and end dates are supplied for the query
* Return true for all leaves with at least one day occurring on or after the query start date - only the start date is supplied for the query
* Return true for all leaves with at least one day occurring on or before the query end date - only the end date is supplied for the query

The following sequence diagram shows how `FindLeaveByPeriodCommand` executes.
<puml src="diagrams/FindLeaveInPeriodSequenceDiagram.puml", width="550"></puml>

A LeaveInPeriodPredicate is constructed from the query supplied by the user, defining both a start (if provided) and end (if provided).
When the command is executed, the model's FilteredLeaveList is updated to only returns leaves that satisfy the predicate.

### Import file

The import feature allows users to import employee records and leave applications in CSV format, increasing portability of
the user's data. The import feature can provide a means of mass adding employee records and leave applications, without having to use 
the `add` command repeatedly. Since both importing employee records and leave applications involve similar sequences,
the following will describe the sequence for importing employee records.

Here is an example usage of the import feature:
1. User executes the `import` command.
2. User navigates to the file to import using the file dialog that opens.
3. User selects the file and clicks on the Open button of the file dialog.
4. All contacts in the address book will be overwritten by the contents of the imported file

The following activity diagram shows the steps involved in the Import command:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportActivityDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The CSV file is read into a CsvFile object, which is then converted into a CsvSerializableAddressBook object by reading each
row and the corresponding values for each column. The CsvSerializableAddressBook is then converted into an AddressBook instance,
which replaces the current AddressBook instance in the app.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How the user selects files**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Select from graphical file dialog
  * Pros: More intuitive for the user to navigate and locate the file
  * Cons: File dialog is harder to navigate with just the keyboard
* **Alternative 2**: User types in file path in the command
  * Pros: The user can perform the operation entirely by keyboard
  * Cons: Users are more likely to type in the wrong file name, and selecting a file in a different folder would require
  typing out the entire relative file path


### Export feature

The export feature enables users to export employee records and leave applications into CSV format, which can then be opened 
in other spreadsheet applications. It allows users to select filtered data to export, providing greater granularity in
control over file content. Since both exporting employee records and leave applications involve similar sequences, the
following will describe the sequence for exporting employee records.

Here is an example usage of the `export` feature:
1. The user uses the `find-some-tag` command to filter for employees with the `full time` tag
2. The user enters the command `export fulltimers`
3. A file will be created in `{home folder of HRMate}/exports`, with the name `fulltimers.csv`. This file contains employees
with the `full time` tag.

The following sequence diagram shows the steps involved in the Export command:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800"></puml>

ExportContactCommandParser::parseFileName() checks if the file name provided is a valid file name. If the user provided
a path, it strips the path to retain only the file name. Next, it appends a ".csv" extension to the end of the file name
if the user did not supply the extension. 

The export command works by retrieving the filtered employee list in the address book, which contains a list of employee records
that are currently visible in the address book panel. A CsvSerializableAddressBook is constructed from this filtered person list,
which is then serialized into a CsvFile object. CsvUtil then writes the CsvFile instance into a CSV file. This file is
saved in the "export" folder that is created in the same location as the HRMate application file.

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Whether to allow the user to select the location to save the file to**

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Disallow selecting the save location
  * Pros: File dialog is not required as all files will be saved in the same place, allowing the entire operation to be
    performed using the keyboard
  * Cons: Loss of flexibility in choosing the save location, especially if the user wants to save multiple copies with
    the same file name in different locations
* Alternative 2: Allow selecting the save location
  * Pros: Provides flexibility for the user to choose a preferred save location
  * Cons: File dialogs would require the use of a mouse

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0"></puml>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1"></puml>

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3"></puml>


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4"></puml>

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5"></puml>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  A user with above average typing speed (60 or more words per minute) for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
3.  Should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring that HR managers can easily navigate and use its features without extensive training.
4.  HRMate should be capable of handling a growing volume of employee records (up to 1000 persons) without a substantial decrease in performance. It should efficiently manage and store data as the number of employees and records increases over time.
5.  HRMate should complete operations involving a single records within 500ms, and operations involving listing, searching, and filtering within 2s.

## **Appendix: Effort**

HRMate is built for extensibility. Not much effort is needed to implement new commands that are variations of existing features, but effort is needed to add new entities.

### Challenges Faced
The first challenge given is understanding the code infrastructure. HRMate uses many design patterns like Facade pattern, Command pattern and MVC pattern. Without knowledge of these patterns, HRMate would seem complicated and difficult to understand.
Overall the understanding that the `Model` is a Facade for `AddressBook` and `LeavesBook`, input commands follow the Command pattern, and that `AddressBook` and `LeavesBook` are the models, JavaFX is used for the view and `ModelManager` functions as the controller greatly help in the understanding of HRMate's infrastructure.
Another significant challenge is the implementation of the leaves module. Given HRMate's immutable design philosophy, some design choices like replacing stale `Leave` with new instances of `Leave` with the updated `Person` are chosen. Care must be taken to update `Leave` everytime a `Person` is replaced like in the `EditCommand`, `AddTagCommand` and `DeleteCommand`. When adding a new potential module like `Report`, we anticipate that care must be taken when the associated `Person` or `Leave` is replaced.

### Effort Required
To illustrate the difference in effort, the effort needed to create `AddTagCommand` and the `Leave` module will be compared.

Given that `AddTagCommand` is a specific case of `EditCommand`, much of the logic is similar to `EditCommand`. In this case, `AddTagCommand` copies a `Person`, adds the new `Tag` before calling `Model#SetPerson`.

Adding a new command is easy compared to the implementation of the `Leave` module. We took inspiration from the `Person` class and created wrapper classes for the fields like `Title`, `Description` and `Date`. One of the significant challenges were the added constraint of comparing two fields, `start` and `end`. This logic was not present in `Person`. For example `Name` validations do not concern `Tag` validations and vice versa. In `Leave` case, `start` affects the validations for `end`, as `end` must be on or after `start`. To resolve this, we created `Leave`'s constructor to use `Range`, whose creation mandates `start` be on or before `end`. This ensures that the created `Leave` adheres to the constraint of `start` being before or on `end`. We anticipate that the creation of other entities like `Report` to require the creation of new wrapper classes, or even validation classes to enforce validations that span across multiple fields.

Efforts were also spent on ensuring data validity for `Person` and `Leave` when the associated object is modified. As mentioned above, one of the challenges faced was the immutable principle that AB3 used. When a `Person` is edited through `EditCommand`, `AddTagCommand` or `DeleteTagCommand`, the old `Person` is replaced by the newly created `Person`. This results in some `Leave` pointing to the stale `Person`. Thus, `Model#SetPerson` and `Model#DeletePerson` must be amended to edit `LeavesBook` as well to avoid any `Leave` pointing to any stale `Person`. We expect that such methods like `Model#SetPerson`, `Model#DeletePerson`, `Model#SetLeave`, `Model#DeleteLeave` must be amended when adding new modules if the new entities is reliant on information from pre-existing entities.

### Achievements of HRMate
 * Successfully implemented second entity, `Leave` alongside `Person` with information consistency even when `Person` is edited or deleted.
 * Created new way to import data using csv for both `Leave` and `Person`, opening up changing in app data to users who might not understand json.
 * Added 19 more commands while increasing code coverage by 2%.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. `export-all` would export both `Person` and `Leave`. HR Managers usually wants to move both `Person` and `Leave` to another application, so being able to export both in a single csv sheet would help them do so.

2. find-all-tags and find-any-tags searches for tags case insensitive. Since tags are used for categorising, HR Managers might see no difference between Intern and intern. Hence allowing case insensitive search in find-all-tags and find-any-tags would help HR Managers find employees more easily.

3. Mergable `import`. Sometimes, HR Managers want to move data from one app to HRMate without removing all current employees. Allow HRMate to merge a csv file, with an option to overwrite current data or overwrite csv data when a same employee is encountered, would help HR Managers achieve this.

4. Filtered `clear`. Allowing HR Managers to select a group of employees to delete would be good. For example, they could use `find-any-tags t/intern`, `clear` to delete all interns. Subsequently, `list` would show all non intern employees.
