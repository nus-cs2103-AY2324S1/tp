### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-t 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListsPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `ScheduleListPanel`, `CalendarPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="450"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete-t 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-t 1` Command](images/DeleteTutorSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTutorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteTutorCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteTutorCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddTutorCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddTutorCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddTutorCommandParser`, `DeleteTutorCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Schedule` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueScheduleList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* similarly also stores the currently 'selected' `Schedule` objects and this is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Schedule>`
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**
For simplicity, some details such as parsing (`parseIndex`, `parseName`, etc) have been omitted from the implementation details below.

</div>

### Add tutor feature

The "Add Tutor" feature allows users to add a new tutor to the address book. Below, we provide an example usage scenario and a detailed description of how the add tutor mechanism behaves at each step.

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `add-t` command:

<img src="images/AddTutorActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `add-t n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com` to add a tutor to the address book. The 
command is parsed in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `AddTutorCommandParser` is created, which constructs the `Person` to be added.  The `AddTutorCommand` is 
called with the `Person` created.

Step 4. The `AddTutorCommand` object executes the `addPerson` method through the `LogicManager`. The method then 
adds the `Person` in `model` and returns the `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for add tutor operation works:

![AddTutorSequenceDiagram](images/AddTutorSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `AddTutorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Optional fields**
* **Alternative 1:** Allow optional fields when adding tutor (e.g. user can omit phone number or email when adding a 
  tutor).
    * Pros: Allows users to input only necessary fields.
    * Cons: Increases code complexity to handle blank fields.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Disallow optional fields when adding tutor (user must enter name, phone 
  number and email).
    * Pros: Easier to implement, and less error prone.
    * Cons: Users must have every field filled before they can add a tutor.

**Aspect: Non-unique phone number and email restriction**
* **Alternative 1:** Allow only unique phone numbers and emails or tutors.
    * Pros: Decreases erroneous user input when duplicated tutors are entered.
    * Cons: There can be real life scenarios where tutors have the same phone numbers of emails (since there is no 
      strict requirement against it).
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allow only non-unique phone numbers and emails of tutors.
    * Pros: In line with real-life scenario as mentioned above.
    * Pros: Phone numbers and emails are means of contacting the tutors and there is no real need for them to be unique.
    * Cons: Duplicated tutors could be added.

**Aspect: Tutor name restrictions**
* **Alternative 1:** Allow tutors to have name input as only alphabets.
    * Pros: Decreases erroneous user input when phone numbers are accidentally input as names using `n/` tags.
    * Cons: With the implementation of unique names, tutor names cannot be differentiated with numbers.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allow tutors to have alphanumeric names.
    * Pros: Tutors with the same name can be differentiated with numbers.
    * Pros: Tutors' names are restricted to a limited number of characters to promote easy searching and reference 
      in the future. This also introduces uniformity.
    * Cons: Number inputs are accepted as names, and users can erroneously use phone numbers as names instead.
    * Cons: Tutors' names with commas cannot be recognised and entered.
* **Alternative 3:** Allow tutors to have names with special characters, especially commas.
    * Pros: More representative of various name types, especially those with commas in their names.
    * Cons: Allowing too many special characters decreases the ability to locate and reference the tutors in the future 
      (e.g. ABC,123@!?:" should not be accepted as a valid name).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List tutor feature

The "List Tutor" feature allows users to view the list of existing tutors in the address book. Below, we provide
an example usage scenario and a detailed description of how the list tutor mechanism behaves at each step.

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `list-t` command:

![Activity Diagram for list-t Command](images/ListTutorActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 tutor added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-t` to view the full list of existing tutors. The command is parsed in 
`AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. A `ListTutorCommand` object is constructed.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `ListTutorCommand`, which calls the `updateFilteredPersonList`
method with the `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` predicate in the `ModelManager` to remove any filters on the
`PersonList` so that the full list of existing tutors is displayed.

Step 5. Finally, the `ListTutorCommand` object returns the `CommandResult`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for list tutor operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `list-t` Command](images/ListTutorSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

The `list-t` command was designed this way to ensure consistency with the previous `list` command in AB3.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit tutor feature 

The “Edit Tutor” feature allows users to edit an existing tutor in the address book given a tutor index. 

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `edit-t` command:

![Activity Diagram for edit-t Command](images/EditTutorActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 tutor added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-t` to view all added tutors.

Step 3. The user executes `edit-t 1 n/John Doe` to edit the first tutor's name in the list of tutors displayed. 
The command is parsed in `AddressBookParser`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Step 4. `EditTutorCommandParser` is created, and constructs an `EditPersonDescriptor` which describes the edited 
`Person` (omitted in sequence diagram below for brevity). An `EditTutorCommand` object is then constructed with this 
`EditPersonDescriptor` and the specified tutor index.

Step 5. The `EditTutorCommand` object gets the specified `Person` from the current filtered person list using the 
tutor index.

Step 6. `EditTutorCommand` object then creates an edited `Person` from the specified `Person` and the `EditPersonDescriptor`.

Step 7. `EditTutorCommand` object then calls the `setPerson` method in the `ModelManager` with the new edited `Person`. 
This method sets the specified `Person` in the model to be that edited `Person`.

Step 8. Finally, the `EditTutorCommand` object updates the person list to display the edited `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for edit tutor operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit-t 1 n/New Name` Command](images/EditTutorSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `EditTutorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Specifying which tutor to edit**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using tutor index.
    - Pros: Using the tutor index provides a clear and unambiguous way for users to specify which tutor they want to 
      edit. The index corresponds directly to the position of the tutor in the displayed list, making it easy for users 
      to identify the target tutor.
    - Pros: Using the tutor index eliminates the potential challenge of dealing with long or complex names. Users do
      not need to type out the entire name, which can be especially beneficial if a tutor has a lengthy or complicated name.
    - Pros: Using the tutor index aligns with the existing command structure, which is based on numeric indices for 
      identifying and interacting with specific entries in the address book.
    - Cons: Users need to have knowledge of the specific index of the tutor they want to edit. This may require them to 
      first execute a `list-t` command to view the current list of tutors and their corresponding indices.
- **Alternative 2:** Using tutor name.
    - Pros: Allowing users to edit a tutor by specifying their name provides a more natural and intuitive method, as 
      users are likely more familiar with names than numeric indices.
    - Cons: If a user provides an incorrect or misspelled name, the application would need to handle error cases and 
      provide appropriate feedback to guide the user.
    - Cons: Names can be long, complex, or have unusual spellings, which may make them more challenging to type 
      accurately. This can lead to potential input errors or mismatches if the user misspells or mistypes the name.
    - Cons: Names are case-sensitive. This means that users need to accurately input the name with the correct 
      capitalization, which can add an extra layer of precision required from the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Find tutor feature

The "Find Tutor" feature allows users to search for tutors based on the tutor's name. 

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `find-t` command:

<img src="images/FindTutorActivityDiagram.png" width="550"/>

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched.

Step 2. The user executes `find-t John Doe` to search for tutors whose name contains "John" or "Doe. The command is 
parsed in the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `FindTutorCommandParser` is created, and constructs a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` which matches for any of 
the search keywords. A `FindTutorCommand` object is then constructed with this predicate.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `FindTutorCommand` which sets the predicate of the filtered persons 
list in `ModelManager` to be the predicate created earlier.

Step 5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from 
`Logic`.

Step 6. The filtered list of tutors is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for find tutor operation works:

![FindTutorSequenceDiagram](images/FindTutorSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `FindTutorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Search criteria**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allowing users to search for tutors based on their names.
    - Pros: This design provides a straightforward and clear search functionality for users, aligning with the common 
      understanding of searching for specific individuals by name.
    - Pros: It simplifies the search process and reduces cognitive load for users, as they only need to provide the 
      tutor's name.
    - Cons: If a user has incomplete or incorrect information about the tutor's name, they may not be able to find the 
      desired tutor.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
- **Alternative 2:** Specifying search criteria like tutor phone number or email.
    - Pros: Users would have the ability to search for tutors based on a wider range of criteria, such as phone
      number and email.
    - Cons: Implementing advanced search criteria may lead to a more complex user interface and search mechanism, 
      potentially requiring additional user training or guidance.

### Delete tutor feature

The "Delete Tutor" feature allows users to delete an existing tutor in the address book given a tutor index. 
Below, we provide an example usage scenario and a detailed description of how the delete tutor mechanism behaves at
each step. 

The following shows the activity diagram when a user executes the `delete-t` command:

![Activity diagram for delete-t command](images/DeleteTutorActivityDiagram.png)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 tutor added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-t` to view all added tutors.

Step 3. The user executes `delete-t 1` to delete the tutor with index 1 in the list of tutors displayed.
The command is parsed in the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 4. `DeleteTutorCommandParser` is created and gets the index of the tutor to be deleted.
A `DeleteTutorCommand` object is then constructed with the specified tutor index.

Step 5. The `DeleteTutorCommand` object gets the specified person from the current filtered person list using the tutor
index.

Step 6. The `DeleteTutorCommand` object then calls the `deletePerson` method in the `ModelManager` with the specified 
person to delete. This method deletes the specified `Person` in the model.

Step 7. Finally, the `DeleteTutorCommand` object returns the `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for delete tutor operation works:

![Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete-t 1` Command](images/DeleteTutorSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:** 
The lifeline for `DeleteTutorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) 
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

The `delete-t` command was designed this way to ensure consistency with the previous `delete` command in AB3.

**Aspect: Specifying which tutor to delete**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using tutor index.
  - Pros: Using the tutor index provides a clear and unambiguous way for users to specify which tutor they want to 
    delete. The index corresponds directly to the position of the tutor in the displayed list, making it easy for 
    users to identify the target tutor.
  - Pros: Using the tutor index eliminates the potential challenge of dealing with long or complex names. Users do
    not need to type out the entire name, which can be especially beneficial if a tutor has a lengthy or complicated name.
  - Pros: Using the tutor index aligns with the existing command structure, which is based on numeric indices for
    identifying and interacting with specific entries in the address book.
  - Cons: Users need to have knowledge of the specific index of the tutor they want to delete. This may require them to
    first execute a `list-t` command to view the current list of tutors and their corresponding indices.
- **Alternative 2:** Using tutor name.
  - Pros: Allowing users to delete a tutor by specifying their name provides a more natural and intuitive method, as
    users are likely more familiar with names than numeric indices.

    capitalization, which can add an extra layer of precision required from the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Add schedule feature

The “Add Schedule” feature allows users to add a new schedule to the address book. Below, we provide an example usage
scenario and a detailed description of how the add schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `add-s` command:
![AddScheduleActivityDiagram](images/AddScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

The add schedule feature is facilitated by `AddScheduleCommand`. It extends `Command` with the necessary implementation 
to add a schedule to a `Model`. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `AddScheduleCommand#execute(Model)` — Adds the schedule to the `Model`.

This operation is exposed in the abstract `Command` class as an abstract method.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add schedule command behaves.

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 tutor added.

Step 2. The user executes `add-s 1 st/2023-09-15T09:00 et/2023-09-15T11:00` command.

Step 3. The `AddScheduleCommandParser` will be initialized to parse the user input to create a `AddScheduleCommand` 
with a `Index`, `StartTime` and `EndTime` representing the user's input.

Step 4. The `AddScheduleCommand#execute(Model)` will perform the following checks in this order to ensure that the
`Schedule` can be added to the `Model`:
1. The `Index` is valid.
2. A valid schedule can be created with the given `Index`, `StartTime` and `EndTime`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** A `Schedule` is considered valid if 
   its start time is before its end time and both start time and end time falls on the same day. This is enforced by 
   the constructor of the `Schedule` class, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is not valid.

    </div>
3. Executing this command would not result in a duplicate schedule in the `Model`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** A `Schedule` is considered a duplicate 
   if it belongs to the same `Person` and have the same `StartTime` and `EndTime` as an existing schedule in the `Model`.

    </div>
4. Executing this command would not result in a clashing schedule for the tutor specified by `Index` in the `Model`.
    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
   :information_source: **Note:** A `Schedule` is considered a clashing if it belongs to the same `Person` and have 
   overlapping times. This is checked by `Schedule#isClashing(Schedule)`.

    </div>

If any of these checks fail, a `CommandException` with an appropriate error message will be thrown. Otherwise, it will 
create a `Schedule` and use `Model::addSchedule` to add the schedule to the `Model`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how the operation works:

![AddScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/AddScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddScheduleCommandParser` and `AddScheduleCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Checking for clashing schedule:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform the check in `AddScheduleCommand`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Have to directly access schedules in the `UniqueScheduleList`, creating dependencies.
    * Cons: Can be inefficient, as we have to iterate over all schedules in the schedule list.

* **Alternative 2:** Perform the check in `UniqueScheduleList`.
    * Pros: Consistent throughout the system as this check is enforced on all schedules being added to the `UniqueScheduleList` regardless of where it is being added from.
    * Pros: Can be optimised to use more efficient searching algorithms like binary search if the implementation of the underlying list is sorted.
    * Cons: Every schedule in the system have to adhere to that. For e.g., if we want to allow the user to override such constraints it would not be possible without modifying the functionality of the list.

**Aspect: Checking for valid schedule:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform the check in `Schedule`.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Pros: Consistent throughout the system as it does not make any sense to have a schedule with a `StartTime` after its `EndTime`.
    * Cons: Have to handle the exception if an invalid schedule is being created.

* **Alternative 2:** Perform the check in `AddScheduleCommand`.
    * Pros: Allows for flexibility in the constraints.
    * Cons: Have to repeatedly write logic to perform these checks every time a new `Schedule` needs to be created in another class.

### Edit schedule feature

The "Edit Schedule" feature allows users to edit an existing schedule in the address book. Below, we provide an example
usage scenario and a detailed description of how the edit schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

![EditScheduleActivityDiagram](images/EditScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 schedule added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-s` to view all added schedules.

Step 3. The user executes `edit-s 1 st/2023-09-15T09:00` to edit the first schedule's start time in the list of
schedules displayed. The command is parsed in `AddressBookParser`.

Step 4. `EditScheduleCommandParser` is created, and constructs an `EditScheduleDescriptor` which describes the edited
`Schedule`. An `EditScheduleCommand` object is then constructed with this `EditScheduleDescriptor` and the
specified schedule index.

Step 5. The `EditScheduleCommand` object gets the specified `Schedule` from the current filtered schedule list using the
schedule index.

Step 6. `EditScheduleCommand` object then creates an edited `Schedule` from the specified `Schedule` and the
`EditScheduleDescriptor`.

Step 7. `EditScheduleCommand` object then calls the `setSchedule` method in the `ModelManager` with the new edited `Schedule`.
This method sets the specified `Schedule` in the model to be that edited `Schedule`.

Step 8. Finally, the `EditScheduleCommand` object updates the schedule list to display the edited `Schedule`.

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Setting of schedule status**
* **Alternative 1:** Use an additional prefix to edit the status of a schedule. 
  * Pros: Allows users to directly edit the schedule status using the edit schedule command. 
  * Cons: Edit schedule command would have a considerable number of tags (it already has 3). It would also not match 
    up with add schedule command.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Have a separate command for setting schedule status. 
  * Pros: It is more intuitive to the user and separates the responsibility of edit schedule. 
  * Cons: Requires separate commands for marking and unmarking schedule status.

**Aspect: Reassigning of tutor**
* **Alternative 1:** Allow user to edit the tutor allocated to the schedule. 
  * Pros: Allows users to easily modify schedule details, including allocated tutor. 
  * Cons: Users will need to provide the schedule index to identify the schedule to be edited, and provide the tutor 
    index that the schedule should be allocated to. This is difficult to implement with one list view.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):**  Users cannot edit the tutor allocated to the schedule.
  * Pros: An additional optional flag is not needed, and the new tutor to be allocated does not need to be 
    identified from the tutor list.
  * Cons: In the editing of schedule, a `Person` is needed to create a new `Schedule`. Thus, the tutor allocated to 
    the target schedule needs to be obtained and used to create a new `Schedule`.

### List schedule feature

The "List Schedule" feature allows users to list schedules in the address book. Below, we provide an example
usage scenario and a detailed description of how the list schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

![ListScheduleActivityDiagram](images/ListScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 schedule added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-s` to view all added schedules.

Step 3. The user can also choose to execute `list-s 1 m/0` where the `Index` and `Status` are optional parameters.

Step 4. The `ListScheduleCommandParser` will be initialised to parse the user input, checking for `Index` and `Status`. If they are provided but invalid, it will throw a `ParseException`.

Step 5. The `ListScheduleCommandParser` will then create a `ListScheduleCommand` with a `Index` and `Status` representing the user's input.

Step 6. If `Index` is a valid integer, but it is not within the schedule list of indexes, `ListScheduleCommand::execute` will return `CommandException` .

Step 7. `ListScheduleCommand::execute` then creates `TutorPredicate`, `StatusPredicate` or both predicates, depending on what parameters are present in the user input for `Index` and `Status` respectively.

Step 8. `ListScheduleCommand::execute` then calls `ModelManager::getFilteredScheduleList` with the predicate as the argument.
This method updates the list of schedule in the model according to the predicate conditions and filters them.

Step 9. Finally, the `ListScheduleCommand` object updates the schedule list to display the filtered schedules.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for list schedule operation works:

![ListScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/ListScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `ListScheduleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Filtering schedule by tutor name**
* **Alternative 1:** Use an additional prefix to filter the list of schedules by tutor name.
    * Pros: Provides users the flexibility to various filter options in 1 command.
    * Cons: Too many prefixes and parameters for listing a schedule, which will make it too different from its `list-t` command counterpart in usage.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Have a separate command for finding schedule by tutor name.
    * Pros: It is more intuitive to the user since there is already a similar command `find-t`.
    * Cons: Requires separate commands for searching schedules by keywords in the tutor's name.


### Find schedule feature

The "Find Schedule" feature allows users to search for schedules based on the tutor's name.
The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `find-s` command:

<img src="images/FindScheduleActivityDiagram.png" width="550">

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched.

Step 2. The user executes `find-s John Doe` to search for tutors whose name contains "John" or "Doe. The command is parsed in the
`AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `FindScheduleCommandParser` is created, and constructs a `TutorNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` which matches for any of
the search keywords. A `FindScheduleCommand` object is then constructed with this predicate.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method in `FindScheduleCommand` which sets the predicate of the filtered schedule
list in `ModelManager` to be the predicate created earlier.

Step 5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from
`Logic`.

Step 6. The filtered list of schedules is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for find tutor operation works:

![FindScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/FindScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `FindScheduleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Design Rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Search criteria**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only allowing users to search for schedules based on their names.
    - Pros: This design provides a straightforward and clear search functionality for users, aligning with the common
      understanding of searching for specific schedules by the assigned tutor's name.
    - Pros: It simplifies the search process and reduces cognitive load for users, as they only need to provide the
      tutor's name.
    - Cons: If a user has incomplete or incorrect information about the tutor's name, they may not be able to find the
      desired schedule assigned by that tutor.
- **Alternative 2:** Specifying search criteria like start date time or end date time.
    - Pros: Users would have the ability to search for schedules based on a wider range of criteria, such as start date time and end date time.
    - Cons: Implementing advanced search criteria may lead to a more complex user interface and search mechanism,
      potentially requiring additional user training or guidance.

### Mark schedule feature

The "Mark Schedule" feature allows users to mark a specified schedule as missed or completed.
Below, we provide an example usage scenario and a detailed description of how the mark schedule mechanism behaves at
each step.

The following shows the activity diagram when a user executes the `mark` command:

![MarkScheduleActivityDiagram](images/MarkScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 schedule added.

Step 2. The user executes the `list-s` to view the list of schedules.

Step 3. The user executes the `mark 1 m/1` command, which marks the schedule with index 1 shown in the list of 
schedules displayed as completed. The command is parsed in the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 4. `MarkScheduleCommandParser` is initialized to parse the user input to create a `MarkScheduleCommand` with
the given `Index` and `Status` representing the user's input.

Step 5. The `MarkScheduleCommand#execute(Model)` will perform the following checks in this order to ensure that the
schedule can be safely marked as completed in the Model:

1. The `Index` is a valid integer.
2. The `Index` is not out of bounds (within the range of displayed schedule list's size).
3. The `Status` is valid (either 0 for missed or 1 for completed).

Step 6. The `execute` method then calls `Model::getFilteredScheduleList` and gets the specified `Schedule` using the
`Index` given.

Step 7. Once the checks are successful, the method then creates an edited `Schedule` from the original `Schedule` with its
status set to completed.

Step 8. The method then calls the `setSchedule` method in the `ModelManager` with the new edited `Schedule`. This sets the
specified `Schedule` in the model to be that edited `Schedule` with completed status.

Step 9. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from
`Logic`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for mark schedule operation works:

![Sequence diagram for mark command](images/MarkScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `MarkScheduleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Usage of the `pending` status**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users unable to mark a schedule as `pending`.
  - Pros: This design is more intuitive for users, as it aligns with the common understanding of marking and
    unmarking tasks.
  - Pros: Users only need to be aware of the completed and missed status, simplifying the command's usage.
  - Cons: The user must use a distinct command to unmark schedules with a status set.
- **Alternative 2:** Users able to mark a schedule as `pending`.
  - Pros: Users only need to be familiar with the `mark` command, which can toggle between completed, missed, and
    pending statuses. This may lead to a more streamlined user experience.
  - Cons: Introducing a third status option complicates the management of schedule statuses. Users and developers
    alike must account for an additional state, potentially increasing the system's complexity.
  - Cons: The definition and usage of the `pending` status may vary among users, potentially leading to ambiguity in
    its interpretation.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Aspect: Format of schedule status**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users input integers `0` or `1` to mark a schedule as `missed` or `completed`.
  - Pros: Using integers provides a clear and unambiguous way for users to specify which status they want to
    mark for the specified schedule. The index corresponds directly to the schedule status of `missed`, or `completed`,
    making it easy to identify the correct schedule status.
  - Pros: The use of integers eliminates the potential challenge of dealing with case-sensitive words. Users do
    not need to type out the exact status word by word, which can be especially beneficial if a user is not a very
    good at typing.
  - Pros: The use of integers aligns with the existing command structure, which is based on numeric indices for
    identifying and interacting with specific entries in the address book.
  - Cons: Users need to have knowledge of the specific integer representing the schedule status they want to mark. 
- **Alternative 2:** Users input the exact schedule status `missed` or `completed` in words.
  - Pros: Allowing users to mark a schedule by specifying their schedule status provides a more natural and intuitive 
    method, as users are likely more familiar with status than numeric integers.
  - Cons: If a user provides an incorrect or misspelled status, the application would need to handle error cases and
    provide appropriate feedback to guide the user.
  - Cons: Typing out schedule status in words are case-sensitive. This means that users need to accurately input the 
    schedule status with the correct capitalization, which can add an extra layer of precision required from the user.

**Aspect: Number of `m/` tags accepted**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users input more than one `m/` tags and only the last `m/` tag is taken.
  - Pros: Users who are fast typists can easily correct earlier mistakes without deleting text.
  - Pros: There are less erroneous behaviours that will result in failure of the command (e.g. entering `m/0 m/0 
    m/1` will result in the schedule being marked as `completed`, as opposed to encountering an error).
  - Cons: Some users may be confused about the behaviour of the command especially if tags provided are conflicting.
- **Alternative 2:** Users input only one `m/` tag. Multiple tags will result in an error.
  - Pros: The command is unambiguous to use, since multiple (hence conflicting) tags are not accepted. 
  - Cons: It is inconvenient for fast typists to have to go back to previously typed commands to edit fields.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Unmark schedule feature

The "Unmark Schedule" feature allows users to unmark a schedule that was previously marked as completed or missed. 

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `unmark` command:

![UnmarkScheduleActivityDiagram](images/UnmarkScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 schedule marked as completed or missed.

Step 2. The user executes `list-s` to view the list of schedules.

Step 3. The user executes `unmark 1` command, which unmarks the schedule with index 1 shown in the list of schedules 
displayed. The command is parsed in the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 4. `UnmarkScheduleCommandParser` is initialized to parse the user input to create an `UnmarkScheduleCommand` with 
the given `Index` representing the user's input.

Step 5. The `UnmarkScheduleCommand#execute(Model)` will perform the following checks in this order to ensure that the 
`Schedule` can be safely unmarked in the Model:

1. The `Index` is a valid integer.
2. The `Index` is not out of bounds (within the range of the displayed schedule list's size).

Step 6. The `execute` method then calls `Model::getFilteredScheduleList` and gets the specified `Schedule` using the 
`Index` given.

Step 7. Once the checks are successful, the method then creates an edited `Schedule` from the original `Schedule` with its
`Status` set to pending.

Step 8. The method then calls the `setSchedule` method in the `ModelManager` with the new edited `Schedule`. This sets the 
specified `Schedule` in the model to be that edited `Schedule` with pending status.

Step 9. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from
`Logic`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for unmark schedule operation works:

:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `UnmarkScheduleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Existence of unmark command**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate `unmark` command for unmarking schedules.
    - Pros: This design is more intuitive for users, as it aligns with the common understanding of marking and 
      unmarking tasks.
    - Pros: Users only need to be aware of the completed and missed status, simplifying the command's usage.
    - Cons: The user must use a distinct command to unmark schedules with a status set.
- **Alternative 2:** Using a pending status with `mark` Command.
    - Pros: Users only need to be familiar with the mark command, which can toggle between completed, missed, and 
      pending statuses. This may lead to a more streamlined user experience.
    - Cons: Introducing a third status option complicates the management of schedule statuses. Users and developers 
      alike must account for an additional state, potentially increasing the system's complexity.
    - Cons: The definition and usage of the "pending" status may vary among users, potentially leading to ambiguity in 
      its interpretation.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Delete schedule feature

The "Delete Schedule" feature allows users to delete an existing schedule in the address book given a schedule index.
Below, we provide an example usage scenario and a detailed description of how the delete schedule mechanism behaves at
each step.

The following shows the activity diagram when a user executes the `delete-s` command:

![Activity diagram for delete-s command](images/DeleteScheduleActivityDiagram.png)

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

The delete schedule feature is facilitated by `DeleteScheduleCommand`, which extends from `Command` with the necessary implementation to delete a schedule by a given index.
The following operation is exposed in the abstract `Command` class as an abstract method:
* `DeleteScheduleCommand#execute(Model)` - Deletes the schedule from the `Model` using the given index.

Given below is an example scenario on how the delete schedule command behaves:

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 schedule added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-s` to view the list of schedules.

Step 3. The user executes `delete-s 1` command, which deletes the schedule with index 1 shown in the list of schedules displayed. The command is parsed in the `AddressBookParser`.

Step 4. `DeleteScheduleCommandParser` is initialized to parse the user input to create a `DeleteSchedulecommand` with the given `Index` representing the user's input.

Step 5. The `DeleteScheduleCommand#execute(Model)` will perform the following checks in this order to ensure that `Schedule` can be safely deleted from the `Model`:

1. The `Index` is a valid integer.
2. The `Index` is not out of bounds.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:** An `Index` is considered valid if it's within the range of the schedule list's size. This is enforced by throwing an `CommandException` if it is not valid.
</div>

Step 6. The `execute` method will then call `Model::getFilteredScheduleList` and get the specified Schedule using the `Index` given.

Step 7. Once the checks are successful, the method then calls `Model::deleteSchedule` in `ModelManager` to delete the specified `Schedule` in the model.

Step 8. Finally, the `DeleteScheduleCommand` returns the `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for delete schedule operation works, taking `execute("delete-s 1")` API call as an example.

![Sequence diagram for delete-s command](images/DeleteScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

The `delete-s` command was designed this way to ensure consistency with the previous `delete` in AB3.

### Show calendar feature

The "Show Calendar" feature allows users to view schedules based on a specific date. 

The following shows the activity diagram from when a user executes the `show` command:

<img src="images/ShowCalendarActivityDiagram.png" width="550">

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user has the application launched.

Step 2. The user executes `show 2023-09-15` to view schedules for September 15, 2023. The command is parsed in the 
`AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `ShowCalendarCommandParser` is created, which constructs a `Date` based on the user-provided date. 
A `ShowCalendarCommand` object is then constructed with this date.

Step 4. The `LogicManager` calls the execute method in `ShowCalendarCommand`, setting the predicate for the filtered 
schedules list in `ModelManager` to be the predicate that shows all schedules and setting the predicate for the filtered
calendar schedules list in `ModelManager` to only display schedules on the specified date.

Step 5. The filtered list of schedules for the specified date is displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for the show calendar operation work:

![ShowCalendarSequenceDiagram](images/ShowCalendarSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `ShowCalendarCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Defining which tutor to display for calendar**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show calendar for all tutors
    - Pros: Provides a comprehensive view of schedules for all tutors, allowing users to see the entire schedule at a 
      glance.
    - Pros: Offers a unified view that may be suitable for administrators or users managing multiple tutors.
    - Cons: May present a large amount of information, potentially leading to information overload for users with many 
      tutors.
    - Cons: Users may need to filter or navigate through a longer list of schedules to find the specific information 
      they are interested in.
- **Alternative 2:** Specify tutor to show calendar for.
    - Pros: Offers a focused view of schedules for a particular tutor, allowing users to quickly access and manage the 
      schedule for that specific individual.
    - Pros: Reduces visual clutter and streamlines the user interface for users primarily interested in one tutor.
    - Cons: May not be as suitable for administrators or users managing multiple tutors, as they may need to switch 
      between tutors to view their respective schedules.
    - Cons: Users may need to specify the tutor they want to view, requiring additional input.

### Change theme feature

The "Change Theme" feature allows users to change the colour theme of the address book. Below, we provide an example 
usage scenario and a detailed description of how the change theme mechanism behaves at each step.

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `theme dark` to change the address book theme to dark. The command is parsed in 
`AddressBookParser`.

Step 3. `ThemeCommandParser` is created.  The `ThemeCommand` is called with the filepath and theme to be changed to.

Step 4. The `ThemeCommand` object returns the `CommandResult` where `isTheme` is true.

Step 5. The `handleChangeTheme` method is called from `MainWindow` with the new theme to change to.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Saving to UserPrefs**
In order for the app to apply the last used theme when run again, the theme has to be saved to `GuiSettings` on exit.
* Implementation of saving last used theme is similar to implementation of saving window width and height in AB3.
* An additional method `getCurrentTheme` is called to obtain current theme during `handleExit`.
* When the app is opened, the theme from `GuiSettings` is applied, along with window width and height.
This is not depicted in the following sequence diagram, which focuses on implementation of changing theme.

</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how the above steps for change theme operation works:

![ChangeThemeSequenceDiagram](images/ChangeThemeSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
The lifeline for `ThemeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

**Aspect: Parsing the NEW_THEME**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** New theme is parsed and the filepath is allocated in `ThemeCommandParser`.
  - Pros: This design is in line with how `FindTutorCommand` and `FindScheduleCommand` obtain the keyword to 
    implement predicate to get the filtered lists, within their respective parsers.
  - Cons: The filepath needs to be passed to `ThemeCommand` to construct `CommandResult` with the filepath. The 
    filepath is then obtained from `CommandResult` at `MainWindow`.
  - Cons: Thus, `CommandResult` needs another constructor and getter method.
- **Alternative 2:** New theme is parsed and the filepath is allocated in `AddressBookParser`.
  - Pros: Switch cases are handled early and the command is verified in the same place it was parsed.
  - Cons: The filepath needs to be passed to `ThemeCommandParser` and `ThemeCommand` to construct `CommandResult` with 
    the filepath. The filepath is then obtained from `CommandResult` at `MainWindow`.
  - Cons: Thus, `CommandResult` needs another constructor and getter method.
- **Alternative 3:** New theme is parsed and the filepath is allocated in `MainWindow`.
  - Pros: The filepath does not need to pass through `ThemeCommand` and `CommandResult`. It is allocated and access 
    from `MainWindow` directly. Thus, `CommandResult` does not need another constructor and getter method.
  - Cons: `MainWindow` has to parse arguments.

### Split `MainWindow` to display both tutor and schedule list together

The main window of TutorConnect now displays both the tutor and schedule list side by side to give users an overview
and provide easy reference when inputting commands to update the tutors or schedules.

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

To display both the tutor and schedule list together, another panel `ListsPanel` is used to combine both the 
`PersonListPanel` and `ScheduleListPanel` together in order to display them as a single panel in the `MainWindow`.

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

Initially, the list of tutors and schedules are individual panels and the `MainWindow` can only display one at a time.
Therefore, users have to enter `list-t` or `list-s` commands to alternate between panels to refer when entering
tutor-related commands followed by schedule-related commands or vice versa, which can be very troublesome.

With the use of `ListsPanel` to combine both lists into one single panel to display in the `MainWindow`, it eliminates
the need to alternate between panels as users can now enter tutor-related and schedule-related commands while having
reference to both lists at the same time, providing convenience for users.

### Sorting of schedules

The list of schedules is sorted to be more organised and easier to navigate for users.

#### Implementation details
{:.no_toc}

The schedules are sorted by implementing the `Comparable` interface and its required `compareTo` method.

#### Design rationale
{:.no_toc}

`Schedule`s are sorted by `StartTime` as start time is what tuition centre coordinators are most concerned with.

The schedules are divided into 2 parts: future and past, this organizes the schedules in a way that simplifies 
navigation for the users. This allows them to quickly differentiate between upcoming and past schedules.

The upcoming schedules are sorted in ascending order so that the most immediate schedules, which are the ones
that are most relevant to the user at that point in time, is at the very top. 

Past schedules are sorted in descending order, this keeps the more recent schedules readily accessible, while the older, 
less relevant schedules are at the bottom of the list.

## **Appendix: Planned enhancements** 

Given below are the planned enhancements for future iterations of the app.

### Tutor name case sensitivity
The current [add tutor feature](#add-tutor-feature) validates unique tutor names with case sensitivity (e.g. John 
DOe is different from john Doe). This may not be applicable in the real world. We plan to remove the case 
sensitivity check for tutor names.

**Proposed implementation**

In the `isEquals` method in the `Name.java`, the check for the same tutor using their names can be replaced with one 
that removes capitalisation of the tutors' names before checking if they are equal.

### Editing a tutor allocated to a schedule
The `edit-s` function should allow users to edit the allocated tutor.

The current [edit schedule feature](#edit-schedule-feature) does not allow editing of assigned tutor. We plan to 
allow reassignment of tutor by adding a new prefix to edit schedule command `t/` which allows users to specify a tutor index to reassign the 
schedule to. Proper input validation and error handling would be in place to ensure safe modifications to the schedule.

In the planned enhancement of this feature, alternative 1 of [reassigning the tutor](#design-rationale-2) will be 
implemented. This is possible because of the double list view.

This implementation will remove the need for the tutor of the schedule to be edited to be obtained and fixed.

**Proposed implementation**

Step 1. The user has the application launched with at least 1 schedule added.

Step 2. The user executes `list-s` to view all added schedules.

Step 3. The user executes `edit-s 1 t/1 st/2023-09-15T09:00` to edit the first schedule's start time in the list of
schedules displayed and to assign the schedule to the first tutor instead. The command is parsed in AddressBookParser.

Step 4. EditScheduleCommandParser is created, and constructs an `EditScheduleDescriptor` which describes the edited
`Schedule`. An EditScheduleCommand object is then constructed with this `EditScheduleDescriptor` and the
specified schedule index.

Step 5. The EditScheduleCommand object gets the specified schedule from the current filtered schedule list using the
schedule index and the current filtered person list using the tutor index.

Step 6. EditScheduleCommand object then creates an edited schedule from the specified schedule, using the specified 
tutor, and the `EditScheduleDescriptor`.

Step 7. EditScheduleCommand object then calls the setSchedule method in the ModelManager with the new edited schedule.
This method sets the specified `Schedule` in the model to be that edited schedule.

Step 8. Finally, the EditScheduleCommand object updates the schedule list to display the edited schedule.

### Disallowing future schedules to be marked
The `mark` function should prohibit setting a schedule status if either the start or end time is in the future.

**Proposed implementation**

An extra validation should be included in the `execute` method within the `MarkScheduleCommand` to ensure that both the 
scheduleToEdit's start and end times are earlier than the current datetime.

If this validation fails, a `CommandException` with a clear and descriptive error message should be thrown.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Streamline datetime input
In the current implementation, the users have to enter `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm` each time for both `StartTime` and `EndTime`.
However, since a `Schedule` is not allowed to start and end on different days, the user is unnecessarily repeating the
input `yyyy-MM-dd`. This resulted in a command format that is longer than necessary. We plan to streamline the command 
to make it shorter and more user-friendly.

**Proposed implementation**

The current `st/` and `et/` prefixes will be updated to take in `HH:mm` only. Additionally, this would require a new 
prefix `d/` which will parse user input in the `yyyy-MM-dd` format into a `Date`.

For example, any command that uses the `st/` or `et/` prefix will now use `... d/yyyy-MM-dd st/HH:mm et/HH:mm` instead.

### Tutor and schedule information view
In the current implementation, tutors and schedules with long fields of over 40 characters are truncated. They can 
be seen by resizing the window. To improve user experience, the information should be able to be viewed by users 
without the window resizing.

**Proposed implementation**

In the `PersonListCard` and `ScheduleListCard`, the column constraints should be removed. This will add a horizontal 
scroll bar in the event the information to be displayed is too long.

### Calendar row view
In the current implementation, schedule details cannot be viewed in the calendar for schedules that are shorter than 
45min long. The additional details are truncated. These details cannot be viewed even with resizing the window and 
can only be viewed in the `list-s` view.

**Proposed implementation**

In the `CalendarRow`, the column constraints should be removed. This will add a horizontal scroll bar in the event 
the information to be displayed is too long.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Switching back to list view from calendar view
In the current system, when executing any commands, including actions like marking, unmarking, or deleting schedules 
while in the calendar view, the GUI switches back to the main view displaying the list of tutors and schedules. This 
behavior can be disruptive and frustrating for the user.

To enhance user experience, we propose implementing a more persistent calendar view. This would allow the user to 
perform certain actions on schedules without being returned to the list view.

Only certain actions, such as adding or editing schedules, should return the user to the main list view. This is
because these actions necessitate the clearing of any applied filter predicate including the one that was used to
display schedules only for the specified date.

Conversely, other actions should keep the user within the calendar view.

**Proposed implementation**

A new boolean attribute `exitCalendar` will be added to `CommandResult`, which indicates whether the command executed
should exit the calendar view (if active).

The `execute` methods for commands like `AddScheduleCommand` and `EditScheduleCommand` will return a `CommandResult` 
object with this new attribute set to `true` while all other commands will have the value `false`.

In the `handleListDisplay` method in `MainWindow`, it will call `showLists` only if this attribute is `true` and 
do nothing otherwise. The only exception is if the `commandResult` FeedbackToUser is a 
`ShowCalendarCommand.MESSAGE_SUCCESS` in which case it will call `showCalendar`.

### Schedules at the same time being arranged alphabetically
In the [current implementation](#sorting-of-schedules), the schedules are being sorted by `StartTime` only.

This resulted in a situation where if you had many schedules starting at the same time, it would be very difficult to 
find and locate a particular schedule.

**Proposed implementation**

The schedules would be sorted first by `StartTime`, then by `EndTime`, and finally alphabetically by the tutor's name.
This would make the schedule list more organised, making it easier to use and navigate for the user.

### Accepting one input for theme change
In the current implementation, the `theme` command disregards any other input after the first. For example, `theme 
dark blue` is regarded as `theme dark`. This may cause confusion for some users.

**Proposed implementation**

Within the parsing of the input in `ThemeCommandParser`, a `ParseException` would be thrown when more than one word 
after the command word is detected. This means that `theme dark blue` would result in a `ParseException` and only one 
word after the command word `theme` is accepted.

### List schedule by pending status
In our current implementation, `list-s` only filters schedule by `COMPLETED` or `MISSED` status. Any schedules that have 
not been assigned one of these statuses are categorised as unmarked, and it's important to include them in the list-s results.

**Proposed implementation**

1. Update `list-s` command and `m/` parameter value to accept an additional value for unmarked status to filter by, such as `m/u`.
2. This can be done by modifying `ListScheduleCommandParser.java` and `Status.java` to map an integer to enum `Status` that represents umarked status.
3. When `ListScheduleCommand:execute` runs, the command should accept another input from `m/` parameter that represents the umarked status, such as `m/u`.
4. Then `Model::updateFilteredScheduleList` will take in `StatusPredicate.java` to filter schedules based on unmarked status.
