### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 2.1.1 Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

#### 2.1.2 How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](./images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `WellNusParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `WellNusParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `WellNusParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.4 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the wellnus storage data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both wellnus storage data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `WellNusStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3. WellNus Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features of WellNus are implemented.
### 3.1 Cancelling an Appointment

The canceling of an appointment is facilitated by the `CancelCommand`. It extends `Command` and allows the user to cancel an appointment at a specified index.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("cancel 1")` as an example.

![Interactions inside the Logic component for "cancel 1" command](images/CancelSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design Considerations: How an Appointment should be canceled**

* **Current Choice:** Create a new `CancelCommand` class which handles the cancellation of an appointment.
    * Pros: User input will be shorter and easier to read.
    * Cons: More work to implement.

* **Alternative 1:** Add appointment cancellation functionality to the existing `DeleteCommand`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: User will have to type longer commands since appointment details can be lengthy, which may lead to more complex commands.

### 3.2 Student Notes feature

The adding of student notes is facilitated by `NoteCommand`. It extends `Command` and allows the addition of a `Note`
to the student at the index specified by the user.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component,
taking `execute("note 1 note/Likes dogs.")` as an example.

![Interactions inside the Logic component for "note 1 note/Likes dogs." command](images/NoteSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design Considerations: How a `Note` should be added to a `Student`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `NoteCommand` class which handles the addition of a note
  to a `Student`.
    * Pros: User input will be shorter in length and easier to read
    * Cons: More work to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Add `Note` as a field in the `AddCommand`
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: User will have to type much longer commands, since `Note` can be up to 200 characters long,
      leads to very lengthy commands

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3 View Feature

This feature is facilitated by the use of the ViewCommand class which extends the Command interface.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.
![Interactions between LogicManager and ModelManager for a view command](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ViewCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

View Command handles both the viewing of all students and all appointments. The workflow is shown below:
![ViewCommand Control Flow](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There should be a diamond connecting the 4 separate branches
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the 4 branches leads to the "end" individually .
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4 Check overlapping appointments feature

The *check overlapping appointments* mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueAppointmentList`. It implements the `Iterable`
interface that stores an `ObservableList` of type `Appointment`. When an `Appointment` is scheduled, the
`ScheduleCommand#execute(Model model)` method begins the check.

The following methods are implemented to facilitate the check clashing appointments process:

* `Model#hasOverlappingAppointments(Appointment toAdd)` —  The Model responsible for adding the appointment (In this case, `WellNUS.java`).
* `UniqueAppointmentList#hasOverlapWith(Appointment toAdd)` —  Checks if the appointment to add overlaps with any of the current appointments in the `UniqueAppointmentList`.
* `Appointments#isOverlappingAppointments(Appointment other)` —  Checks if this `Appointment` overlaps with the given `Appointment` supplied in the parameter.


The following sequence diagram shows how the class operates when an appointment is added:

![OverlapSequenceDiagram](images/OverlapSequenceDiagram.png)


When the user schedules a new command, the `UniqueAppointmentList` runs its `hasOverlappingAppointments()` method to check if the
new appointment clashes with any existing appointments. It raises a `OverlappingAppointmentsException` if the method returns true,
and prevents the user from scheduling that appointment.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user schedules an apppointment:

![ClashActivityDiagram](images/ClashActivityDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There should be a diamond connecting the 3 separate branches
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the 3 branches leads to the "end" individually .
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. Planned Enhancements

### 4.1 Customisable color for risk levels
The current colors for risk levels of low, medium and high are green, blue and red respectively.
Risk levels are color coded for easy identification by counsellors.
However, users may find the current risk level color contrast hard to see, hence we plan to make the colors customisable to cater for different preferences.

### 4.2 Allow name to include special characters
The current parameter constraints for name is name must only contain alphabetical characters and space, be unique up to 100 characters long, and cannot be blank.
However, we do acknowledge the need for special characters in names such as `Arjun S/O Kapoor`, hence we plan to include special characters to cater for diverse student names.

### 4.3 Command to view notes
The current method of viewing notes requires double-clicking on the `StudentCard` which reflects a GUI approach. To cater to users who prefer the CLI approach,
we plan to introduce a command that achieves the above equivalent function.

### 6.4 Non-Functional Requirements
1.  Cross-Platform Compatibility:
    - Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Scalability and Performance:
    - Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
    - Should support efficient data retrieval and manipulation for the specified contact volume.
3.  Usability and Efficiency:
    - A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should 
    be able to perform the majority of tasks more quickly using _CLI_ commands compared to using a mouse on the _GUI_.
    - The _CLI_ interface should prioritise efficiency by providing clear and concise commands, minimising unnecessary prompts,
    and offering time-saving shortcuts.
4. Updates and Maintenance:
    - Updates should not disrupt the user's workflow or data.

*{More to be added}*

### 6.5 Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface. Usually the in-built terminal or in the IDE the application is run on.
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.

## 8. Appendix: Effort

### 8.1 Design Challenges

* WellNUS, in contrast to AB3 which exclusively manages one entity type: `Person`,
has the intricate challenge of handling two distinct entity types: `Student` and `Appointment`.
* One challenge encountered was the need to manage dependencies between the two entity types.
Specifically, the system had to be designed to prevent the scheduling of appointments unless a corresponding student entity existed. 
Additionally, to maintain data integrity, the deletion of a student entity necessitated the simultaneous cancellation of all associated appointments.
* In tackling these challenges, we leveraged existing components to streamline development efforts. 
Recognising the `Person` entity in AB3, we opted to adapt the `Person` entity and repurpose to `Student` entity within WellNUS.
* Another challenge we faced was designing a new `Appointment` entity from scratch. The process was challenging and required tedious class refactoring mid-implementation.
Initially, we designed `Appointment` to have an attribute `DateTime` to store the date and time of the appointment. 
To facilitate the comparison of appointments and prevent overlaps and clashes, we soon realised there was a need for a start and end time.
However, having `DateTime start` and `DateTime end` results in a duplication of date, as the appointment was bound to be on the same date. 
Hence, we refactored `DateTime` into `Date` and `Time` to allow for 3 attributes: `Date appointmentDate`, `Time startTime`, `Time endTime`
* For the UI of WellNUS, we also faced challenges handling `Appointment` and `Note`, specifically, how these
entities are to be displayed to the user. For `Appointment`, we settled on having an `Appointment` list similar to the
`Person` list in AB3, and simultaneously display 2 lists for `Student` and `Appointment`.
* On the other hand, while we initially displayed `Note` under its corresponding `Student`, similar to `Remark` in
AB3, we eventually decided against it. Our `Note` was designed for counsellors to make consultation notes in addition
to remarks for students, and is usually much longer than a typical `Remark` in AB3, this led to each
row in the `Student` list becoming much more cluttered and wordy. Eventually, we created a separate column that
specifically displays a single `Note` of the user's choice.

### 8.2 Technical Challenges

* Since WellNUS manages both `Student` and `Appointment` entities, one of the challenges we faced was refactoring our
`Storage` component to handle both entities simultaneously. While saving `Student` and `Appointment` data to the storage
file was much easier since we could reference AB3's `Storage` component, loading data from file proved to be a much
larger challenge especially in a brownfield project.
* The loading in AB3 simply checks if there are any duplicate `Persons`, on the other hand, having
an `Appointment` entity meant that, we had to perform checks for duplicate `Appointments`, overlapping `Appointments`
and also whether the `Student` provided in the `Appointment` exists in the given WellNUS data file.
* In addition, because we decided to refactor `Person` in AB3 into `Student`, the initial refactoring for `Person` was
tedious and proved to be a challenge. Removing redundant fields like `Email` and `Tags` and adding fields like `RiskLevel`
and `Note` meant that a large portion of the AB3 had to be refactored, since the majority of the code in AB3 involved
the `Person` entity, including tests, sample data and UI.
* We decided that adding student notes was essential to our application as it is part of a counsellor's job. While it was 
easy to add a student note, it was difficult to find a convenient way to display the `Note` as the `Note` for the student can be very long.
We could not simply just show the `Note` together with rest of the details in the `StudentCard` as it will not be
visually-pleasing. We wanted to make it easy by double-clicking on a student card to display the student notes separately.
It proved to be challenging to handle event-listeners from various components of the UI as only after
trying different workflows, we realised that the best way is pass a FunctionalInterface from the `StudentNotePanel` over to the `StudentCard`
to update the `StudentNotePanel` when the event is triggered. This was especially difficult as most events originally were triggered by
command inputs.
