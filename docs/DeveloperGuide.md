### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/networkbook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

These parts may use custom component classes such as `FieldHyperlink` that
inherit from default JavaFX components. These subclasses can provide
reasonable defaults or part-specific behavior to simplify code.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/networkbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `NetworkBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `NetworkBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `NetworkBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Here is an overview of what the other classes in `Logic` do:
* `ArgumentMultiMap` and `ArgumentTokeniser` are used to map the parameters of 
the user's input into key-value pairs, where the keys are specified using `ArgumentTokeniser`
* `CliSyntax` is where command-specific keywords are stored. It is used as the arguments for `ArgumentTokeniser`
to process the user input into: `{keyword : parameter}` pairs.
  * Example usage: The text `1 /name John Doe /phone 98765432` when
    mapped using `ArgumentTokeniser` with the keywords `/name`
    and `/phone` produces:
    * `{1}, {/name : John Doe}, {/phone : 98765432}`
    * Any text that appears before the first possible keyword is stored
      in its own entry.
  * `ArgumentMultiMap` can then perform specific operations, including
    but not limited to:
    * Retrieve all values/only a specific value from the set.
    * Check that a certain key only appears once, or exactly once.
* `ParserUtil` contains useful commands for parsing text such as removing
  leading/trailing whitespace from text, verifying that there are no 
  duplicate entries in the text, and so on.

The activity diagram below describes the workflow of `AddressBookParser`
when determining which `Parser` to use:
* `TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 1.4`

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the
`FilterCommand` class to generate a `FilterCommand` object, using
`ArgumentMultiMap` and `ArgumentTokeniser`:
* `TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 1.4`

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/networkbook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1200" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the networkbook data, which in turn is all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueList<Person>` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* exposes the current list of displayed person as a `Observable<Person>` obtained from the `VersionedNetworkBook`.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The `VersionedNetworkBook` component,

* stores the currently filtered `Person` objects (the result of a filter) as a separate _filtered_ list. This list is used as the intermediate list between the original `UniqueList<Person>` and the _sorted_ list.
* stores the sorted list `Person` objects (the result of a filter and a sort) as a separate _sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a list of states that can be backtracked/forwarded to. This list is extensively used in undo and redo command.

The `UserPrefs` component,

* stores the GUI settings of window size and position.
* stores the path of the data file.

The `UniqueList<T>` class,

* is a generic class that ensures that items within the list conforms to the unique constraint. In other words, each pair of objects within the list must have a different identity. `UniqueList<T>` enforces `T` to implement `Identifiable<T>`, which has the method `isSame(T)` to check for identity against another object.
* The identity is determined by the class that `T` binds to.
  * For `Person`, the identity is the name. Two names are equal if there string values are equal.
  * For `Phone`, the identity is the literal string value of the phone.
  * For `Email`, the identity is the literal string value of the email.
  * For `Link`, the identity is the literal string value of the link.
  * For `Course`, the identity is the literal string value of the course name.
  If two courses are of the same name but of different start and end dates, they are considered having the same identity.
  * For `Specialisation`, the identity is the literal string value of the specialisation.
  * For `Tag`, the identity is the literal string value of the tag.
* `UniqueList<T>` does an identity check upon adding every object to the list. It throws an `AssertionError` if duplicates are found.
  * Any actor that wants to add an object to the list must ensure that an identity check has been done before the add method is called.
* `UniqueList<T>` supports supplying the object at the specified index to a consumer through the method `consumeItem(int index, ThrowingIoExceptionConsumer<T> consumer)`. The method takes the item at `index` and passes it into the `consumer`.
* `UniqueList<T>` supports supplying the object at the specified index to a consumer, at the same time applying a function on the same object to produce a value through the method `consumerAndComputeItem(int index, ThrowingIoExceptionConsumer<T> consumer, Function<T, U> function)`. The method works the same as above, and does an extra step of applying `function` on the object and return the computed value of type `U`.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `NetworkBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.networkbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create new contact

The implementation of the create command follows the convention of a normal command,
where `CreateCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string
into an executable command.

![create_contact](images/create/CreateDiagram.png)

`CreateCommandParser` first obtains the values corresponding to the flags
`/name`, `/phone`, `/email`, `/link`, `/grad`, `/course`, `/spec`, `/priority`, `/tag` and `/index`.
`CreateCommandParser` ensures that:
* There is no preamble text between the `create` keyword and the flags.
* One and only one of the flag`/name` is present.
* At most one of the flags `/grad` or `/priority` is present.
* All values corresponding to the flags `/name`, `/phone`, `/email`, `/link`, `/grad`, `/course`, `/spec`, `/priority`, `/tag` and `/index` are valid.

If any of the above constraints are violated, `CreateCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `CreateCommand` that corresponds to the user input.

`CreateCommand` comprises of the person to be added, which is an instance of `Person`.

Upon execution, `CreateCommand` first queries the supplied model if it contains a person with an identical name.
If no such person exists, `CreateCommand` then calls on `model::addPerson` to add the person into the networkBook data.


We have considered the following alternative implementations:
* Implement `CreateCommandParser` to parse the arguments using regular expressions.
  This is not optimal for our use case as having a regex expression to parse the field values would be more complicated to scale and debug.

### Edit details

The implementation of the edit command follows the convention of a normal command,
where `EditCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string
into an executable command.

<img src="images/edit/EditDiagram.png" width="1200">

`EditCommandParser` first obtains the values corresponding to the flags 
`/name`, `/phone`, `/email`, `/link`, `/grad`, `/course`, `/spec`, `/priority`, `/tag` and `/index`.
`EditCommandParser` ensures that:
* One and only one of `/name`, `/phone`, `/email`, `/link`, `/grad`, `/course`, `/spec`, `/priority`, `/tag` is present.
* If `/name`, `/priority` or `/grad` is present, then `/index` is not present.
* If `/phone`, `/email`, `/link`, `/course`, `/spec` or `/tag` is present, then one and only one tag `/index` is present.

If any of the above constraints are violated, `EditCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`. 
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `EditCommand` that corresponds to the user input.

`EditCommand` makes use of `EditPersonDescriptor`, which is an editable version of `Person` class.
Most importantly, 
* `EditPersonDescriptor` constructor copies the details of the person.
* `EditPersonDescriptor` has setter methods to allow changing the details.
* `EditPersonDescriptor` has a `toPerson` method that returns a new instance of `Person` that matches the current details.

`EditCommand` comprises of the `index` of the person to edit, and `editAction` as an instance of `EditAction`. 
Each `EditAction` implements `edit(EditPersonDescriptor)`,
which mutates the input instance of `EditPersonDescriptor`.
`EditAction` is an interface that has implementing concrete classes corresponding to each type of action
(i.e. `EditPhoneAction` for editing phone, `EditEmailAction` for editing email, etc).

Upon execution, `EditCommand` first obtains the `Person` at the index `index` in the model.
`EditCommand` then creates a new instance of `EditPersonDescriptor` that matches the details of the `Person`.
`EditCommand` then calls on `editAction::edit` to mutate the created `EditPersonDescriptor`.

`EditCommand` then converts the current `EditPersonDescriptor` into a new `Person`.
`EditCommand` then asks the `model` to update the original `Person` with the edited `Person`.

We have considered the following alternative implementations:
* Implement `EditCommand` with only `EditPersonDescriptor` and without `EditAction`,
and `EditCommandParser` generates the instance of `EditPersonDescriptor` directly.
`EditCommandParser` then must know the details of the person editing
in order to generate the correct instance of `EditPersonDescriptor`.
This is not optimal for object-oriented programming,
as the parser should not need to know how the current model looks like.
* Use a different class for each type of edit command 
(i.e. editing phone with `EditPhoneCommand`, editing email with `EditEmailCommand`, etc).
This design has the advantage that the parser does not need to know how the current model looks like.
However, to keep `Command` classes consistent in design, 
we decide to only have one `EditCommand` class and practice inheritance with `EditAction`.
* Implement `EditCommand` such that `EditAction` edits the `Person` object directly.
This means that `Person` class must be mutable, which breaks the defensiveness of the current code and has the potential of introducing more bug.
Moreover, the `Person` class being immutable also accommodates for the `undo` and `redo` command,
in which the `VersionedNetworkBook` only creates a shallow copy of the current list of `Person` objects
and hence any mutation of the `Person` object might introduce bugs.


### Open link/email

The implementation of the opening link/email command follows the convention of normal command, where `OpenEmailCommandParser`/`OpenLinkCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command. Below illustrates the process for open link command. The process of opening email is similar, where the reader can simply replace `link` with `email` to get the process for opening email.

![open link diagram](images/open/OpenDiagram.png)

`OpenLinkCommandParser` first obtains the values corresponding to the preamble and the flag `/index`, and return an object of class `OpenLinkCommand`.
* If there are multiple `/index` tags, `OpenLinkCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`.
* If there is no `/index` tag, the link index takes the default value of `1`.

`OpenLinkCommand` then executes on the `Model` to open the link at `personIndex` (index of contact) and `linkIndex` (index of contact). The `Model` calls on the `NetworkBook`, which then calls on the `Person` at the correct index to open the link at `linkIndex`.

The `Person` opens the link by first detects which OS the application is running on.
* On Windows, the `Person` executes `Desktop::browse(URI)`, where [`Desktop`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Desktop.html) and [`URI`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F7%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/net/URI.html) are java classes from default packages.
* On Mac OS, the `Person` executes the `open` command in the terminal through the [`Runtime`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F7%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/lang/Runtime.html) class, which is a built-in class in java language. The `open` command in the terminal opens the computer's default browser if the `URI` supplied is correctly formatted to be a web link.
* On Ubuntu, the `Person` executes the `xdg-open` command in the terminal through the [`Runtime`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase%2F7%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java/lang/Runtime.html) class.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature
    
#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedNetworkBook`. It extends `NetworkBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `networkBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedNetworkBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedNetworkBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedNetworkBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitNetworkBook()`, `Model#undoNetworkBook()` and `Model#redoNetworkBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedNetworkBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitNetworkBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `networkBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitNetworkBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `networkBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitNetworkBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `networkBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoNetworkBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial NetworkBook state, then there are no previous NetworkBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoNetworkBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoNetworkBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `networkBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone NetworkBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoNetworkBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitNetworkBook()`, `Model#undoNetworkBook()` or `Model#redoNetworkBook()`. Thus, the `networkBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitNetworkBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `networkBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Sorting feature

#### Implementation

The sorting feature builds on the existing filter feature present in `Model`. `Model` has a getter method `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` which returns an `ObservableList<Person>`. `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` is called by `LogicManager#getFilteredPersonList()`, which is then called in `MainWindow` to render a filtered list of contacts. The implementation of the filter feature in `ModelManager` uses JavaFX's `FilteredList`, an implementation of the `SortedList` interface.

The new sort feature makes use of JavaFX's `SortedList`, another implementation of the `ObservableList` interface. `SortedList` takes a predicate which it then uses to sort the list.

To implement the sort feature, the method `Model#updateSortedPersonList()` was exposed via the `Model` interface. A `SortedList` was then added to the implementation in `ModelManager` as a wrapper of the existing `FilteredList`. `ModelManager`'s implementation of `updateSortedPersonList()` method updates the predicate of the `SortedList`. Finally, the implementation of `getFilteredPersonList()` was updated to return the sorted list.

The sort command updates the predicate of the model's `SortedList` to a `PersonSortComparator`. `PersonSortComparator` extends `Comparator<Person>`, adding in a few extra methods specific to sorting persons:

* `parseSortField()` parses a given string into a value of the `SortField` enumeration. This value is then used later to determine the predicate implementation.
* `parseSortOrder()` parses a given string into a value of the `SortOrder` enumeration. This value is then used later to determine the predicate implementation.
* `generateXXComparator()` methods. These methods return comparators which compare based on XX field of Person in either ascending or descending order.
* `generateComparator()` takes in a `SortField` and `SortOrder` and calls the relevant `generateXXComparator()` based on the given sort order and field.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the app. The rendered list is unsorted and unfiltered.

<!-- todo insert diagram -->

Step 2. The user executes `find al` command to filter contacts by name. This updates the predicate of the `FilteredList` to only show contacts with names matching "al". The `SortedList` predicate remains unchanged (i.e. `null`).

<!-- todo insert diagram -->

Step 3. The user executes `sort /by name /order desc​` to sort the filtered list by name in descending order. The `sort` command parser calls `PersonSortComparator#generateComparator()` to generate the appropriate comparator. The sort command then calls `Model#updateSortedPersonList()`, updating the predicate of the `SortedList`. This newly sorted list is then rendered in the main UI.

<!-- todo insert diagram -->

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `find` command is called again, the sorting will persist.
