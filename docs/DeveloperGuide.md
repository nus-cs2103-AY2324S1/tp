### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shutdown.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shutdown, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence
Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete NRIC`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete NRIC")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/NewModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/PersonPackageClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Patient`, `Doctor` and `Appointment` objects.
* all objects are stored in the respective implementations of an abstract `UniqueObjectList`
* stores the currently 'selected' `Patient`, `Doctor` or `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<T>` (where T is a `Patient`, `Doctor` or `Appointment`) that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Patient/Doctor Feature

This feature allows users to add patients or doctors to the address book. No duplicate person should be added. There are many fields for each patient/doctor which can be found in the user guide. The implementation for adding patient and doctors are similar, we just need to change the relevant command name from patient to doctor. For the below details, we will just use patient when mentioning the commands.

#### Implementation

Implementation of adding patients is similar to the original addCommand. The adding mechanism is facilitated by the AddressBook in the model.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add patient/doctor mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The AddressBook will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user types `add-patient` (or `add-doctor`) as command, with the appropriate arguments for the person, for example, `add-patient n/John Doe ic/S9851386G g/M p/98765432 ec/90123456 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/T0123456H c/pneumothorax b/O+`.

Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` parses the arguments and determine the required command parser based on the first word of the arguments.

Step 4. Then `addPatientCommandParser` parses the remaining arguments and creates an `AddPatientCommand` with the
details of the patient given.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the details of the person added does not match the correct format for any fields, there will be an error telling user that the attributes are in the wrong format.
</div>

Step 5. The `AddPatientCommand` then gets executed and calls the Model#addPatient() and the patient will be added to
the `uniquePatientList` of the addressbook in the model.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the Person to be added is already in the respective list in the addressbook, it will
return an error saying that this is a duplicate person. This will be checked during the execution of the Add command.
</div>

Step 6. The UI should display using the updated list of patients and the newly added patient should be in the patient
section of the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add patient works:

![AddPatientSequenceDiagram](images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design Considerations

1. Option 1 (Current Choice): Use two different commands for adding patients and doctors
    - Pros: Easier to implement. Clear to the user which type of person to add, since we have different fields for
      patients and doctors.
    - Cons: Increased number of classes and tests.
2. Option 2: Use a single add command like the original implmentation
    - Pros: Fewer files to be changed.
    - Cons: Harder to implement, since we will have more checkings to be done when adding the person.

### Edit Patient/Doctor Feature

This feature allows users to edit patients or doctors to the address book. The person must already
exist in the address book. There are many fields for each patient/doctor to be
edited which can be found in the user guide.

#### Implementation

Implementation of editing patients is similar to the original editCommand. The editing mechanism is facilitated by the
AddressBook in the model.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit patient/doctor mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The AddressBook will be initialized with the initial
address book state.

Step 2. The user types `edit T0123456H` (or the relevant ic number) as command, with the appropriate arguments for the person, for
example, `edit T0123456H n/John Doe g/M p/98765432 ec/90123456 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 d/T0123456H c/pneumothorax b/O+`.

Step 3. The `AddressBookParser` parses the arguments and determines that the EditCommandParser is required based on the first word
of the arguments.

Step 4. Then `editCommandParser` parses the remaining arguments and creates an `EditCommand` with the
details of the patient given.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:**  If the details of the person added does not match the correct format for any fields,
there will be an error telling user that the attributes are in the wrong format. Also, if there are no attributes passed there will be an error.
It's ok if the attributes are the same as the original attributes. 
Lastly, an NRIC must be provided and if the nric cannot be found within the list of doctors and patients, there will be an error.
</div>

Step 5. The `EditCommand` then gets executed and calls the Model#setPerson() with the original person and the new
edited person. The original person will be replaced by the edited person.

Step 6. The UI should display using the updated list of patients and the newly edited person should reflect the changes
in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add patient works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Design Considerations

1. Option 1 (Current Choice): Use a single EditCommand for both doctors and patients
    - Pros: Easier for the user. Can use a single command to edit both.
    - Cons: The program has to check whether the person is a doctor or patient. This mandates that a person cannot
    be both a patient as a doctor, as patients have additional attributes. The program also might be slightly slower 
   since it has to check through both the doctors and patients list to locate the person.
2. Option 2: Use 2 commands edit-patient and edit-doctor
    - Pros: The program might be faster. If you call edit-doctor you only need to search through a few doctors
      rather than all the patients as well.
    - Cons: Harder to implement, and there's a need to create new classes and add repeated code. More commands for the user to remember as well.

### Delete Patient/Doctor Feature

This feature allows users to delete the desired patient or doctor based on the
NRIC provided.

#### Implementation

Implementation of the delete feature is similar to the original delete command, except that it is done with nric instead
of Index.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The AddressBook will be initialized with the initial
address book state.

Step 2. The user populates the AddressBook with patients and doctors using the appropriate commands, if not already
done.

Step 3. The user types `delete` as the command, with the appropriate NRIC of the patient/doctor to be deleted, for
example `delete S9567312G`.

Step 4. The `deleteCommandParser` parses the delete command and creates a `deleteCommand` with the target Ic.

Step 5. The PatientCard / DoctorCard then processes the deletion and The UI should display the updated list without the
deleted Doctor/Patient.

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Create New Appointment Feature

This feature allows users to create a new appointment between patients and doctors. The patient and doctor for whom the
appointment is created should already exist in the address book. No conflicting appointment should be added (i.e, the
same doctor/patient cannot have 2 different appointments at the same time. More details about the fields for Appointment
can be found in the user guide.

#### Implementation

Implementation of creating an appointment is comprised of fairly new code. The adding mechanism is facilitated by the AddressBook in the model.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the new appointment mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The AddressBook will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user populates the AddressBook with patients and doctors using the appropriate commands, if not already done.

Step 3. The user types `new-appointment`as command, with the appropriate arguments for the appointment, for example,
`new-appt pic/T0123456H dic/S9851586G time/2022-02-14 13:00:00`.

Step 4. The `Doctor` and `Patient` Class methods are used to add the details to the respective objects. This works in a similar way to how the `NRIC` Class works for the `Doctor` and `Patient` Classes. `Appointment` is done externally for
OOP reasons.

Step 5. The `addPatientCommandParser`/ `addDoctorCommandParser` parses the Appointment and creates an `AddPatientCommand`/ `addDoctorCommand` with the details of the `Appointment` given.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the details of the person added does not match the correct format for any fields,
there will be an error telling user that the attributes are in the wrong format.
</div>

Step 6. The `PatientCard` / `DoctorCard` then processes the appointment details and The UI should display the appointment details for each Person in the AddressBook.

The following sequence diagram and activity diagram shows how the New Appointment works:

![AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)
![AddAppointmentActivityDiagram](images/AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png)


### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by two ArrayLists of AddressBooks stored in the Model Manager class,
which are the redoList and the undoList. Each time an action is performed, the two lists are updated accordingly
by the following three methods:

* `Model#updateBackup()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `Model#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state by retrieving it from the undoList.
* `Model#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state by retrieving it from the redoList.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The undoList and RedoList will both be initialised as
empty ArrayLists, and the `addressBook` instance, `ab0`,  stores the current AddressBook.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete NRIC` command to delete a person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#updateBackup()`, causing the current `addressBook` instance, `ab0`, to be added to the undoList while the 
model now stores the updated address book with the deleted person, `ab1`,  as the new `addressBook` instance.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add-patient n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also
calls `Model#updateBackup()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into undoList, `ab1`, and the 
current `addressBook` instance to be updated to the new `ab2`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateBackup()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the undoList.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will add the current `addressBook` instance,
`ab2` to redoList, as well as removing the most recently added AddressBook, `ab1`, from the undoList and setting it as 
the new `addressBook` instance.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the undoList is empty, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command checks if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redo()`, which restores the addressBook to its previous state 
before the `undo` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the redoList is empty, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command checks if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user then decides that the person he added in step 3 was not a mistake, and executes the command `redo`.
The `redo` command will call `Model#redo()`, which will add the current `addressBook` instance,
`ab1` to undoList, as well as removing the most recently added AddressBook, `ab2`, from the redoList and setting it as
the new `addressBook` instance. Notice that the current state has been restored to the state at the end of step 3.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the number of AddressBook states stored
in the undoList reaches 5, any additional commands that makes changes to the address book will lead to the least
recently added state in the undoList to be purged as a redundant state and will no longer be accessible via `undo`.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Clinic staff who:

* have a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: When medical emergencies arise, it becomes crucial to provide rapid access to emergency contacts
and patients' details. Our app provides a way to efficiently navigate through pertinent contacts for their everyday
tasks.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

### Better Command error messages

Currently, some error messages can be better phrased to help users identify the problems in their commands. For example, when deleting a patient with an invalid IC like S111, the error message is invalid format. However, showing that the IC is invalid may be more helpful

### Allow Name to take more types of inputs

Currently, when adding or editing a new patient or doctor, the input for name only accepts Alphanumeric characters. However it may be an issue for people with legal names that include "s/o someone", "Ah-Ming". Hence, we plan to loosen the checks for name input and allow the system to take in more special characters like "/,-".

### Make Find Command not case-sensitive

Currently, our find-appt command used to find appointment only accepts capitalised letters for the NRIC input. However, given that we have allowed for non-capitalised letters for other command types that uses NRIC, we plan to improve find command to case-insensitive for NRIC. 

### Handle manual changes in JSON file

Currently, changing the data file directly for the appointments are not checked. It is possible that users edit the data file directly such that an appointment not belonging to the person is stored under him. This will cause issues later on when users attempt to add appointments at the same timing. We plan to add in more checks in when converting json properties such as JsonAdaptedPatient and JsonAdaptedDoctor to their respective model type. These validation ensures that the data in the json file adheres to the checks that are done when adding new appointments to doctors and patients.

## **Appendix: Effort**

There are 4 main areas where we adapted substantially from the original AB3.
1. UI now displays patients, doctors and appointment details.
2. System now contain Patient and Doctor class that inherits from the Person class.
3. System now contain a completely new class Appointment that stores patient and doctor ic, and the appointment.
4. Undo and Redo commands added.

### UI changes
Compared to the original UI, our app now shows three columns, Patient, Doctor, Appointment. We had to figure out how to fit 3 different columns in JavaFX which we were not familiar with. Additionally, linking the changes in model with the the actual UI component was also difficult since there many different files involved. We had to really trace through the code to understand how the different components work together to show the required UI that we wanted.

### Person to Patient and Doctor
MediLink Contacts adapted from the AB3 to use the Patient and Doctor classes to represent the information that our target users will need. The original code base was deeply linked to the Person class and there was a significant amount of changes that had to be made to refactor the code to accommodate the two classes.  The biggest challenge was that we had to understand the entire code base well at the beginning to be able to make these refactorings.

Some changes were also made to such that the two classes have their own attributes on top of the original Person attributes and inherit from the common class Person. There are now 2 instead of just 1 entity that has to be handled. This translates to more Parsers, attribute classes and input validations to support these two classes.

We also decided that Patient and Doctor tags should provide meaning in the context of our app and thus, we decided to create restrictions. The biggest challenge here was the parsing of the tags as it had to be changed throughout multiple commands and in the EditCommand, the initial parsing does not check if the person is a Patient or Doctor, which meant we had to carefully check later on that valid tags were indeed edited.

Additionally, we moved away from using Index for most of our operations. Instead, we perform all operations using the NRIC. This also means more changes to the existing command such as Edit/Find/Delete commands.

### Appointment class
This is a newly created class that represents a relationship between the Doctor and Patient class. Am AppointmentTime class was also created to represent the time used in the Appointment class. One challenge that we faced was to come up with the required checks for adding new appointment. We decided to go with whether the inputted IC exist in MediLink Contacts and whether the new appointment causes a clash with the doctor and patient. However, actually implementing these checks were difficult as we had to find a way to get the same Patient and Doctor stored in the model. 

Storing the appointment was a challenge too. We store each appointment in the involved doctor and patient such that we can search for their appointments more easily as well as a separate list in the model, that has all the appointments. We had to create new JsonAdaptedAppointment class for this purpose.

### UniqueObjectList class
To further enhance our application, we created an abstract UniqueObjectList class that can store any object in the required format for use in the addressbook. Using this class, we instantiated UniquePatientList, UniqueObjectList and UniqueAppointmentList. This also allows for future improvements as any new object list to be store can be simply instantiated as a child of UniqueObjectList.

### Undo and Redo
As we wanted to allow our users to revert back some mistakes, we implemented the undo and redo functions, which are fairly new compared to the existing functions that are mainly CRUD related. These changes had to be tied to each individual commands as we had to store the different states of the system before and after each operation is performed. Hence, the code changes were across many files and had to be linked well for it to work. Additionally, we faced a challenge coming up with the best possible implementation, as there were multiple ways for us to revert the data files. We eventually decided on 
storing an ArrayList of AddressBooks and faced a challenge figuring out how to update the UI, which we eventually managed to resolve through extensive searching and fixing.
