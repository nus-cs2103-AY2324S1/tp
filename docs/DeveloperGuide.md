### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2.This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3.The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4.The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Room Statistics PieChart

#### Implementation

The Room Statistics PieChart is facilitated by the RoomPieChart class, and the actual pie chart object is created using
the DoughnutChart class. This is designed to enable hotel receptionists to be able to determine the
number of available and unavailable rooms at a glance during the hustle and bustle of handling multiple
guest check ins, allowing them to be able to either report to their manager or supervisor the current number of rooms
occupied, or to inform a guest that they are entertaining that perhaps a specific room that they desire is not available
due to the large number of rooms occupied on that day.

The primary functions of the class include:

- `RoomPieChart(ObservableList<Booking> bookingList)` - Creates the pie chart object with the appropriate dimensions and labels.

The RoomPieChart object is updated by the `handleViewRoomStatistics()` method declared in /main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java class,
which is called after every command except `find` command is returned. The reason why it is not updated after `find` is because
the pie chart is generated using the filteredList returned after every command, and since `find` generates a filteredList
based on the user's input, we do not want to update the pie chart with only the Bookings that fit the user's input.

The following sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the pie chart being updated after each command result is returned:

![](images/PieChartSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Execution of handleViewRoomStatistics():**

- **Choice:** Edit the CommandResult method signature to take in another boolean parameter to indicate whether handleViewRoomStatistics is called.
    - Pros: For every command, it is easy to edit the command's class to either update the pie chart or not.
    - Cons: Might be too simple of an implementation. If the developer chooses to add in more complex commands that rely on other commands, regressions may occur.

- **Alternative:** Use a ListChangeListener object to monitor the list to see if there is a change in the number of bookings, and call handleViewRoomStatistics accordingly.
    - Pros: Reduces chances of regressions occuring when more complex commands are added as updating the pie chart only relies on any changes to the Bookings list.
    - Cons: Demands a more complex implementation.

**Aspect: Indication of room pie chart failures:**
- **Choice:** Show pie chart
    - Pros: Visually noticeable to users as they can see if there is no change to the pie chart when there should be or the pie chart is not shown at all.
    - Cons: Users may somehow not notice that the pie chart is not changing.

### Prefix Autocomplete

#### Implementation

The prefix autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by the `PrefixCompletion` class. This class is designed to recommend possible prefixes that a user can use to complete their commands more efficiently.

The primary functions of the class include:

- `PrefixCompletion#getNextCompletion(String currentInput)` - Provides the next possible prefix recommendation based on the user's current input.

`PrefixCompletion` is used in the `CommandBox` class. When the user presses the `TAB` key, the `handleTabPressed` method is invoked, which runs the `PrefixCompletion` to auto-complete the user's current input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the prefix completion mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user starts typing a command in the command box.
2. Upon pressing the `TAB` key, the current text in the command box is passed to the `PrefixCompletion#getNextCompletion` method.
3. The method checks the user's input to determine the appropriate command (e.g., `add`, `edit`) and use necessary `PrefixFinder` to find the unused prefix.
4. If a suitable prefix is identified, it is appended to the user's current input in the command box, accompanied by an example value. The example value is highlighted for easy replacement by the user.
5. If no suitable prefix is identified or if the user's input isn't recognized, the command box runs `CommandBox#indicateCompletionFailure()` which signals the user to adjust their input by adjusting the text color for 0.5s.

The following sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the prefix autocomplete operation within the `CommandBox`:

![](images/PrefixCompletionSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Execution of prefix autocomplete:**

- **Choice:** Uses a predefined list of prefixes and examples for each command.
    - Pros: Simplified implementation. Easy to maintain and update.
    - Cons:
      -Limited to predefined prefixes and commands.
      -Subject to manual change when prefix changes.

- **Alternative:** Dynamically generate example suggestions based on user's history or frequently used parameter.
    - Pros: Offers more personalized and relevant suggestions.
    - Cons: Demands a more complex implementation. Requires a mechanism to track and evaluate user's command history.

**Aspect: Indication of prefix autocomplete failures:**

- **Choice:** Flash the command box with an error style briefly.
    - Pros: Visually noticeable. Informs the user that the autocomplete attempt was unsuccessful.
    - Cons: Might be considered intrusive by some users.

- **Alternative:** Display a tooltip or a message below the command box.
    - Pros: Less intrusive. Clearly communicates the message to the user.
    - Cons: Potential to clutter the UI if not managed gracefully.

### RoomType Tags

#### Implementation

The Room class uses the RoomType enumeration to categorize rooms by type and employs the RoomTypeTag class to generate 
corresponding UI labels. The RoomType enumeration inside the Room class is equipped with a static mapping from room 
numbers to their associated types, enabling swift identification of a room's category based on its number. 
This categorization is then visually represented in the UI by creating RoomTypeTag objects that serve as labels for each room.

The primary functions of the class include:

- `RoomType getRoomTypeByNumber(int roomNumber)` - Uses an internal map to associate room numbers with specific room types, thus enabling quick determination of a room's type.

Given below is an example usage senario and how the prefix completion mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user enters the `add`command with the room number.
2. A Room object is instantiated with a room number passed as a string to the constructor.
3. The constructor parses the string into an integer and calls RoomType.getRoomTypeByNumber to ascertain the room's category.
4. A RoomTypeTag object is created using the name of the determined RoomType, which then facilitates the creation of a UI label for display.

The following sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the prefix autocomplete operation within the `CommandBox`:

![](images/RoomType.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Management of room types:**

- **Choice:** Utilize the RoomType enumeration within the Room class.
    - Pros: Ensures clear and centralized room type definitions, simplifying updates and maintenance.
    - Cons:
        -The static nature of enumeration can limit flexibility, making it harder to adapt to dynamic changes.
        -The direct association between room numbers and types might not easily support modifications in room categorization.

- **Alternative:** Implement a separate RoomType class with dynamic properties.
    - Pros: Adds the ability to handle dynamic changes and offers potential for future scalability.
    - Cons: Complicates the implementation, possibly necessitating new mechanisms for maintaining and retrieving room type information.

**Aspect: Representation of room types as UI labels:**

- **Choice:** Create RoomTypeTag objects from the names of RoomType enumeration constants.
    - Pros: This direct conversion guarantees that the data model aligns seamlessly with the UI's visual elements.
    - Cons:
        -Utilizes the RoomTypeTag class, which may have been initially intended for a broader tagging purpose.
        -Could lead to unnecessary complexity if the RoomTypeTag class functionality significantly overlaps with the RoomType enumeration.

- **Alternative:** Design a specialized UI component dedicated to room types.
    - Pros: Enables custom behavior and appearance specific to room type representation.
    - Cons: Requires additional development work and may result in code redundancy if not carefully integrated with the existing UI components.

### JSON Injection Parser

#### Implementation

The JSON Injection Parser is facilitated by the `JsonInjectionParser` class. It is simply the first parser to be used when parsing through the user input, meant to prevent the user
from inputting possible JSON commands that may be executed when dealing with storing or retrieving memory from the JSON file.

The primary functions of the class include:

- `parse(String args) throws ParseException` - Parses through the user input to check if the input contains any escape characters or characters that could be used to form a JSON command,
and throws a ParseException if the input does contain any of the banned characters.

The following sequence diagram provides a visual representation of the JsonInjectionParser.parse() method being used after a command is passed to Logic.

![](images/JsonInjectionParserSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Execution of parse():**

- **Choice:** Prevent the user from inputting any characters that may constitute a JSON command.
    - Pros: Simple to implement.
    - Cons: This may cause inconvenience to the user.

- **Alternative:** Sanitise the input, ie: remove the banned characters from the input and execute the command.
    - Pros: Less inconvenience to the user.
    - Cons:
        -More complex implementation.
        -Due to the input having some characters removed, the command may either may no sense at all, or in successful execution the details of the command may not make sense to the user at all.
