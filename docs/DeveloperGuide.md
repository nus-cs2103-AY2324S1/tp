## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_contact 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

Return to [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventContactDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

Return to [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_contact 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_contact 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an  `JobFestGoParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteContactCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `JobFestGoParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the `JobFestGoParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1000" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the JobFestGo data i.e., all `Contact`, `Event`, `Tag`, and `Task` objects which are contained in their respective `UniqueContactList`, `UniqueEventList`, `UniqueTagList`, `UniqueTaskList` objects.
* stores the currently selected `Contact`/`Event`/`Tag`/`Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>`/`ObservableList<Event>`/`ObservableList<Tag>`/`ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Return to [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both JobFestGo data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `JobFestGoStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

Return to [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Return to Home feature

The home mechanism is facilitated by `JobFestGo` as well as its observable lists for `Contact`, `Event`, as well as `Task`.

The mechanism interacts with both the UI and the lists stored within `JobFestGo`, particularly `unfilteredContacts`, `unfilteredEvents`, and `filteredTasks`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the home mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user has input any other command that is not `home`.

**Step 2.** The user executes `home` command to return to the home page.
The `home` command calls upon the creation of `TaskInReminderPredicate` while using `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_CONTACTS` and `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS` to update the respective filtered lists.

The following sequence diagram shows how the select event operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/HomeSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="HomeSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the home command:

<puml src="diagrams/HomeActivityDiagram.puml" width="325" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How home is designed**

* **Current choice:** A home command that users have to type in.
    * Pros: Easy to remember and type since it is only 4 letters. Easier to implement with JobFestGo being CLI based.
    * Cons: Not as intuitive to use as Alternative 1.
    <br></br>
* **Alternative 1:** A home button in the accessibility bar right beside `File` and `Help`.
    * Pros: Even easier to use as only one mouse click is required. No typing is needed.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add Tag feature

#### Implementation

The add tag mechanism is facilitated by `JobFestGo` as well as its observable lists for `Tag`.

The mechanism interacts with both the UI and the `filteredTags` list stored within `JobFestGo`.

It includes the following operations in ModelManager which is implemented by Model:

* `Model#addTag(Tag)` — Adds a tag to JobFestGo.
* `Model#updateFilteredTagList(Predicate)` — Updates the filtered tag list according to the given predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add tag mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `JobFestGo` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `add_tag t/vendor` command to add a new tag `Vendor`in JobFestGo.
The parser will parse the command and create a new `AddTagCommand` object, if the entered tag is valid.
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the tag entered contains non-alphanumeric characters, `AddTagCommandParser` will throw an error when creating the `AddTagCommand` object.

</box>

**Step 3.** The `AddTagCommand` object, created in step 2, will call `Model#addTag(Tag)` to add the tag to JobFestGo.
The `AddTagCommand` object will then call `Model#updateFilteredTagList(Predicate)` to update the filtered tag list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add tag operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddTagSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddTagSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddTagCommandParser` and `AddTagCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the add tag command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddTagActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the add tag command accepts tag inputs**

* **Current choice:** Users can input tags comprising only of alphanumeric characters.
    * Pros: Easy to implement due to lesser parsing involved.
    * Cons: Users cannot input tags comprising non-alphanumeric characters, such as spaces and special characters.
    <br></br>
* **Alternative:** Users can input tags comprising alphanumeric characters and non-alphanumeric characters.
    * Pros: Users can input tags comprising non-alphanumeric characters, such as spaces and special characters.
    * Cons: Lesser uniqueness of tags as users can input tags with the same name but different non-alphanumeric characters.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add Event feature

#### Implementation

The add event mechanism is facilitated by `JobFestGo` as well as its observable lists for `Event`.

The mechanism interacts with both the UI and the `filteredEvents` list stored within `JobFestGo`. It holds a reference to the `Model` component, because the `AddEventCommand` relies on the `Model` to add the event.

It includes the following operations in ModelManager which is implemented by Model:

* `Model#addEvent(Event)` — Adds an event to JobFestGo.
* `Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate)` — Updates the filtered event list according to the given predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add event mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `JobFestGo` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `add_event n/NUS Career Fest d/2024-02-15 a/NUS` command to add a new event `NUS Career Fest` on `2024-02-15` in JobFestGo. The parser will parse the command and create a new `AddEventCommand` object, if the entered event is valid.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the event name entered contains non-alphanumeric characters or the date of event is before current date, `AddEventCommandParser` will throw an error when creating the `AddEventCommand` object.

</box>

**Step 3.** The `AddEventCommand` object, created in step 2, will call `Model#addEvent(Event)` to add the event to JobFestGo. The `AddEventCommand` object will then call `Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate)` to update the filtered event list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add event operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddEventSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddEventSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddEventCommandParser` and `AddEventCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the add event command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddEventActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the add event command accepts event name inputs**

* **Current choice:** Users can input the event name comprising only of alphanumeric characters.
  * Pros: Easy to implement due to lesser parsing methods and classes involved.
  * Cons: Users cannot input event names comprising non-alphanumeric characters, such as spaces and special characters.
<br></br>
* **Alternative 1:** Users can input the event name comprising alphanumeric characters and non-alphanumeric characters.
  * Pros: Users can input event names comprising non-alphanumeric characters, such as spaces and special characters.
  * Cons: Harder to implement due to more parsing methods and classes involved. There is a need to create an entire new class for eventName whereas the current implementation uses the existing `Name` class.

**Aspect: How the add event command accepts event date inputs**

* **Current choice:** Users can input the event date in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement due to lesser parsing methods and classes involved.
  * Cons: Users cannot input event dates in other formats.
<br></br>
* **Alternative 1:** Users can input the event date in other formats.
  * Pros: Users can input event dates in other formats.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as `LocalDate#parse(String)` accepts only String of a specific format.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Select Event feature

#### Implementation

The select event mechanism is facilitated by `JobFestGo` as well as its observable lists for `Contact`, `Event`, as well as `Task`.

The mechanism interacts with both the UI and the lists stored within `JobFestGo`, particularly `filteredContacts`, `filteredEvents`, and `filteredTasks`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select event mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `JobFestGo` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

**Step 2.** The user executes `select_event 1` command to select the 1st event in JobFestGo. The `select_event` command calls upon the creation of `ContactIsInEventPredicate` and `TaskIsInEventPredicate` to update the respective filtered lists.

The following sequence diagram shows how the select event operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/SelectEventSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SelectEventSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifelines for `SelectEventCommand` and `SelectEventCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the select event command:

<puml src="diagrams/SelectEventActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How select event executes**

* **Current choice:** Highlights the event selected.
  * Pros: Visually appealing.
  * Cons: Slightly harder to implement.
    <br></br>
* **Alternative 1:** Event list gets updated to only show the selected event.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Users will have to consistently execute home command to view the other events.

Return to [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Link/Unlink feature

#### Implementation

The link/unlink mechanism is facilitated by `JobFestGo` as well as its internally stored `UniqueEventList`.
It implements the following operations:

* `JobFestGo#isContactLinkedToEvent()` — Checks whether a `Contact` is linked to an `Event`.
* `JobFestGo#linkContactToEvent()` — Links a `Contact` to an `Event`.
* `JobFestGo#unlinkContactFromEvent()` — Unlinks a `Contact` from an `Event`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#isContactLinkedToEvent()`, `Model#linkContactToEvent()` and `Model#unlinkContactFromEvent()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the link/unlink mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `link c/Alice Black c/Bob White ev/NUS Career Fest` command to link the contacts specified by the names "Alice Black" and "Bob White" to the event specified by the name "NUS Career Fest" in JobFestGo. The `link` command initiates a loop to iterate through each input `Contact`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `Contact` or the `Event` does not exist in JobFestGo, it is not possible to perform the link operation. `Model#getContact()` or `Model#getEvent()` will throw a `ContactNotFoundException` or an `EventNotFoundException` respectively and an error message will be shown to the user.

</box>

**Step 2.** For each `Contact` in the loop, `Model#linkContactToEvent()` is called, adding the `Contact` to the internally stored associated contact list of the `Event`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `Contact` is already inside the associated contact list of the `Event`, there is no need to perform the link operation again. The `link` command uses `Model#isContactLinkedToEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the link operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/LinkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="LinkSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `LinkCommand` and `LinkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `unlink` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#unlinkContactFromEvent()`, which removes the specified `Contact`(s) from the internally stored associated contact list of the specified `Event`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How link/unlink command gets contacts and event:**

* **Current choice:** Gets contacts and event by names.
    * Pros: Clearer for users to execute the command.
    * Cons: We must devise a new way of getting contacts and event by names since the default implementation is to get by index.
    <br></br>
* **Alternative 1:** Gets contacts and event by index.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users may be confused by multiple indices.

**Aspect: How a mix of valid and invalid input should be handled:**

* **Current choice:** Does not perform any link/unlink operations once there is one invalid input encountered.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users need to re-enter all other input once there is one invalid input.
    <br></br>
* **Alternative 1:** Links/Unlinks all valid input contacts while throwing an error for all invalid contacts.
    * Pros: Users only need to correct the invalid input.
    * Cons: The exceptions are hard to handle.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* is a job festival event planner in Singapore
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts of different types (e.g. vendors, customers) and tasks for different events
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Each event planner has many events to plan, each of which can have a large number of contacts and tasks associated and searching for contact would be a hassle. Our product provides a centralised system that would help job event planners organise their contact information and tasks for quick and easy access.

## **Appendix: Effort**

| Component           | AB3           | JobFestGo                |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Effort              | 10            | 25                       |
| Line of Code        | 6k            | +16k                     |

The JobFestGo project required a significant amount of effort to adapt the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) application to our specific target user profile. One of the major changes was the addition of three new entity types, being `Event`, `Task`, and `Tag`, requiring some modification to the existing model as well as the associated logic and UI components. Another major change that was done was the redesign of the user interface (UI) using JavaFX. This took a significant amount of time and effort to pick up and implement in our project.

Although code was reused from AB3, such code had to be refactored to better fit our application. This can be seen in the `Tag` class, in which now there are some modifications done to ensure that such tags have to be unique, and has to go through the creation and deletion process for validity checks. Furthermore, with the additional entity types `Event` and `Task`, more effort had to be put in for input verification as well as writing high quality test cases for each entity. This is a time-consuming process.

With the addition of the new entity types, we had to map relationships between `Event` and `Task`, as well as `Event` and `Contact`. To tackle this, the team created a list of tasks and a list of contacts inside each event. This brought on multiple changes that had to be made to other components, such that it would be displayed accurately on the UI upon each command. This can be seen in the `LinkCommand` and `UnlinkCommand` for linking contacts to events, and `AddTaskCommand` for adding tasks to events, as well as their relevant parsers and model methods.

Another challenge was the interface redesign, to display the necessary information we wanted. In the case of JobFestGo, this involved adding multiple new UI components, as well as having to carefully construct the flow of events we would like upon each different command being executed. Through multiple testing, we have reached the current stage in which we think best suits the target user profile.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Given below are the planned enhancements for the app for future releases.

1. **Make error messages more useful**

   Currently, the error messages for certain commands are not descriptive enough hence not very useful.
   For example, if the user enters an invalid date such as `2024-04-31` for `add_task`,
   the error message is `Date should be valid and in format YYYY-MM-DD not before today's date`.
   This error message does not help the user much as the user does not know why the date is wrong.
   The error message should be more specific, such as `Entered date is invalid. April 2024 should have DD between 1 and 30 inclusive`.

2. **Allow emails to have top-level domains (TLDs) other than `.com`**

   The email field only allows `.com` TLD in the current implementation.
   This should be changed to allow other TLDs such as `.org`, `.edu`, `.net`, etc.

3. **Allow special characters to be entered in `EventName` and `ContactName`**

    Currently, special characters other than spaces are not allowed in `EventName` and `ContactName`.
    This should be changed to accept these characters to allow for a wider range of valid names.

4. **Upon deletion of a tag, the GUI should remain on `view_tags` screen**

    With the current implementation, when a tag is deleted, the GUI returns to the home page.
    This should be changed to remain on the `view_tags` screen for ease of use and verification of the delete transaction.

5. **Raise error when the same details of a contact is entered in `edit_contact` command**
    
    Currently, when the same details of a contact is entered in `edit_contact` command, the contact is still edited.
    This should be changed to raise an error to inform the user that the edited contact details is the same as the original contact details, so that we can prevent redundant edits.

6. **Use index number instead of event name for commands such as `link` and `add_task`**

    The current implementation of JobFestGo requires the user to enter the event name for commands such as `link` and `add_task`.
    This should be changed to allow the user to enter the index number of the event instead, to allow for faster input.
    Currently, the user has to enter `link n/John Doe ev/NUS Career Fair 2024` to link John Doe to the event NUS Career Fair 2024.
    With the enhancement, the user can enter `link n/John Doe ev/1` to link John Doe to the first event in the event list.

7. **Enforce stricter deadline date for `add_task` command**

   The current implementation of JobFestGo enables users to have tasks with deadline past the event date for AAR purposes.
   For future enhancements, we plan to provide the user the liberty of selecting a period where the event and the tasks for the event will remain in JobFestGo.
   As an example, for `add_event`, there will be another parameter `days_past_event` where we can let the user input the number of days past the event deadline for which tasks can be added.
   The command would look like this: `add_task td/Book Venue d/2024-10-10 ev/NUS Career Fair 2024 days_past_event/7`.
   If the date for the task exceeds this parameter, it will flag an error. 

8. **Remove events and tasks past a particular period**
    
    The current implementation of JobFestGo enables users to have events and tasks with deadline past the event date for AAR purposes.
    Users have to manually delete the events and tasks once completed.
    For future enhancements, continuing from the previous enhancement, we plan to remove the events and tasks past a particular period for better storage management.
    This can be done by checking if the current date is past the event date by the number of days specified in the `days_past_event` parameter.
