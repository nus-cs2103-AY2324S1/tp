### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At application launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the application's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_p 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `Ui` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `Ui` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `Ui` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Appointment`, `Doctor` and `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_a 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_a 1` Command](images/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to a `MediConnectParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteAppointmentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MediConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `MediConnectParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `DeletePatientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

A detailed breakdown of the subclasses of `Data` is shown below:

<img src="images/ModelDataClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the MediConnect data i.e., all `Appointment`, `Doctor` and `Patient` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueItemList<Appointment/Doctor/Appointment>` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Data` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Data>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Database`, which `Data` references. This allows `Database` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Data` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both MediConnect data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `DatabaseStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit Appointment / Doctor / Patient feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the feature that allows users to edit appointments/doctors/patients in the MediConnect database by index.

#### Implementation

The proposed edit appointment/doctors/patients mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager` and it extends `Logic`. It holds a `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and a `Model` where the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit patient mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application. The `Database` will be initialized with all data in the order that it was stored in.

**Step 2**: The user inputs `edit_p 5 p\23456789` command to edit the phone number of the 5th patient in the MediConnect database. The `edit_p` command calls `EditPatientCommandParser#parse(String)` which parses the parameters to edit the current patient with. 
A new `EditPatientDescriptor` instance will be created in the parse command call, and a new `EditPatientCommand` instance will be created with the `EditPatientDescriptor` and the given `Index`.

**Step 3**: The created `EditPatientCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its `execute` method is called.
`EditPatientCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#setPatient(Patient, Patient)` and with the patient of the given `Index` and the target patient created by the `EditPatientDescriptor`.

The example usage scenario for the edit doctor and edit appointment mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#setPatient(Patient, Patient)`, so the database will not be updated.

</div>

**UML Diagrams**

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit patient operation would work:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/EditPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for editing an appointment and editing a doctor would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to edit an appointment/patient/doctor:

![EditXYZCommandActivityDiagram](images/EditXYZActivityDiagram.png)

### Find Doctor / Patient

**Introduction**

This section describes the feature that allows users to find doctors/patients in the MediConnect database by name.

#### Implementation
The finding of a doctor/patient in MediConnect is facilitated by `LogicManager`, which extends `Logic`. It holds a `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and a `Model` where the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)` â€” Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the UI interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `FindDoctorCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user inputs `find_d John` to search for doctors named "John" in the database.
* The `find_d` command triggers `MediConnectParser#parseCommand(String)`, which identifies the command word and calls `FindDoctorCommandParser#parse(String)` to handle the arguments.

**Step 2**: The `FindDoctorCommandParser#parse(String)` method splits the argument "John" into a list of keywords. It then creates a `NameContainsKeywordsDoctorPredicate` object, using the list of keywords.

**Step 3**: A new `FindDoctorCommand` instance is created using the `NameContainsKeywordsDoctorPredicate` object.

**Step 4**: The created `FindDoctorCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager`, and its `execute` method is called.
`FindDoctorCommand#execute(Model)` filters the list of doctors/patients in `Model` using the `NameContainsKeywordsDoctorPredicate`.

**Step 5**: The filtered list is displayed to the user through the UI.

The example usage scenario for the find patient mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

**UML Diagrams**

The following sequence diagram shows how the find doctor operation would work:

![FindDoctorSequence](images/FindDoctorSequence.png)

The sequence diagram for the find patient operation would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to find doctors/patients:

![FindCommandActivity](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### List Doctor / Patients

**Introduction**

This section describes the feature that allows users to list doctors/patients in the MediConnect database.

#### Implementation

The listing of all doctors/patients in the database is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It extends `Logic` and stores the `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and the model in which the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)` â€” Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the Ui interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `ListDoctorCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user inputs `list_d`. The application will display the `FilteredDoctorList`.

* The `list_d` command calls `MediConnectParser#parseCommand(String)` which recognizes the command word as `list_d`.

* A new `ListDoctorCommand` instance will be created.

**Step 2**: The created `ListDoctorCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its execute method is called.

* `ListDoctorCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#updateFilteredDoctorList(Predicate<Doctor>)` with the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DOCTORS`.

* The `FilteredDoctorList` is updated to show all doctors by calling `ObservableList#setPredicate(Predicate<Doctor>)`.

**Step 3**: A `CommandResult` object is created with a message indicating success, and this result is returned to the UI to be displayed to the user.

The example usage scenario for the list patients mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

**UML Diagrams**

The following sequence diagram shows how the list doctor operation would work:

![ListDoctorSequence](images/ListDoctorSequence.png)

The sequence diagram for the list patient operation would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to list a new patient/doctor:

![ListCommandActivity](images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### List Appointments

**Introduction**

This section describes the feature that allows users to list appointments in the MediConnect database. Users can either list all appointments or filter them based on the NRIC of the doctor or/and patient.

#### Implementation

The listing of appointments in MediConnect is facilitated by the `LogicManager`, which implements the `Logic` interface. It holds a `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and a model where the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)` â€” Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the Ui interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `ListAppointmentCommand` mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1**: The user inputs `list_a` to list all appointments or `list_a pic\PATIENT_NRIC dic\DOCTOR_NRIC` to filter appointments.
* The `list_a` command triggers `MediConnectParser#parseCommand(String)`, which identifies the command word and calls `ListAppointmentCommandParser#parse(String)` to handle the arguments.

**Step 2**: The `ListAppointmentCommandParser#parse(String)` method checks for the presence of optional flags like `dic\` for doctor NRIC and `pic\` for patient NRIC.
 * A new `ListAppointmentCommand` instance is then created with the predicate `AppointmentFilterByNricPredicate`.

**Step 3**: The created `ListAppointmentCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager`, and its execute method is called.
 * `ListAppointmentCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#updateFilteredAppointmentList(Predicate)` with the predicate `AppointmentFilterByNricPredicate`.
 * The `FilteredAppointmentList` is updated to show all doctors by calling `Model#updateFilteredAppointmentList(Predicate<Appointment>)`.

**Step 4**: A `CommandResult` object is created with a message indicating success, and this result is returned to the UI to be displayed to the user.

**UML Diagrams**

The following sequence diagram shows how the list appointment operation would work:

![ListPatientSequence](images/ListAppointmentSequence.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to list appointment(s):

![ListCommandActivity](images/ListAppointmentCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Add Appointment / Doctor / Patient feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the add appointment/doctor/patient features.

#### Implementation
The adding of an appointment/doctor/patient to MediConnect is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It extends `Logic` and stores the `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and the model in which the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the `Ui` interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add `Appointment` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application. The `Database` will be initialized with all data in the order that it was stored in.

**Step 2**: The user inputs `add_a pic\T0123456J dic\S9876543F from\2023-12-01 07:30 to\2023-12-01 08:30` to add an appointment into MediConnect.
The `add_a` command calls `AddAppointmentCommandParser#parse(String)` which parses the parameters that build the appointment to be added.
A new `AddAppointmentCommand` instance will be created with the correct `Appointment` object to be added.

**Step 3**: The created `AddAppointmentCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its `execute` method is called.
`AddAppointmentCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#addAppointment(Appointment)` and with the newly created `Appointment`.

The example usage scenario for the add patient and add doctor mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

**UML Diagrams**

The following sequence diagram shows how the add appointment operation would work:

![AddAppoointmentSequenceDiagram](images/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for the add patient and add doctor operations would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to add a new appointment/patient/doctor:

![AddXYZCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddXYZActivityDiagram.png)

### Delete Appointment / Doctor / Patient feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the delete appointment/doctor/patient features.

#### Implementation
The deletion of an appointment/doctor/patient from MediConnect is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It extends `Logic` and stores the `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and the model in which the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the `Ui` interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete `Appointment` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application. The `Database` will be initialized with all data in the order that it was stored in.

**Step 2**: The user inputs `delete_a 2` to delete an appointment into MediConnect.
The `delete_a` command calls `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser#parse(String)` which returns index of the appointment to delete.
A new `DeleteAppointmentCommand` instance will be created

**Step 3**: The created `DeleteAppointmentCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its `execute` method is called.
`DeleteAppointmentCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#deleteAppointment(Appointment)` and with the appointment to be deleted.

The example usage scenario for the delete patient and delete doctor mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

**UML Diagrams**

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete appointment operation would work:

![DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for the delete patient and doctor operations would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to delete an appointment/patient/doctor:

![DeleteXYZCommandActivityDiagram](images/DeleteXYZActivityDiagram.png)

### Edit Remark feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the appointment/doctor/patient remark features.

#### Implementation
The adding/deleting/editing of a remark for an appointment/doctor/patient in MediConnect is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It extends `Logic` and stores the `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and the model in which the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the `Ui` interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit `Remark` of an `Appointment` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application. The `Database` will be initialized with all data in the order that it was stored in.

**Step 2**: The user inputs `remark_a 2 r\follow up required` to edit the remark of the second appointment in the appointment list.
The `remark_a` command calls `AppointmentRemarkCommandParser#parse(String)` which parses the parameters that is used to edit the remark of the appointment specified.
A new `AppointmentRemarkCommand` instance will be created with the `Remark` object to be added to the appointment specified.

**Step 3**: The created `AppointmentRemarkCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its `execute` method is called.
`AppointmentRemarkCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#setAppointment(Appointment, Appointment)` and with the given `Remark`.
The edited `Appointment` is then replaced in the `Database` by calling `Database#setAppointment(Appointment, Appointment)`.

The example usage scenario for the edit patient remark and edit doctor remark mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

![EditRemarkSequenceDiagram](images/EditRemarkSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for the editing patient and doctor remark would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to edit the remark of an appointment/patient/doctor:

![EditXYZRemarkActivityDiagram](images/EditXYZRemarkActivityDiagram.png)

### Add Specialisation / Medical condition / Prescription feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the add specialisations/medical conditions/prescriptions features.

#### Implementation
The addition of a specialisation/medical condition/prescription to an existing doctor/patient/appointment respectively in MediConnect is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It extends `Logic` and stores the `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and the model in which the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the `Ui` interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add specialisation mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application. The `Database` will be initialized with all data in the order that it was stored in.

**Step 2**: The user inputs `list_d`. MediConnect will display the `FilteredDoctorList`.

**Step 3**: The user inputs `add_tag_d 2 t\Orthopaedic` to add the specialisation `Orthopaedic` to the doctor at index 2 in the displayed doctor list.
The `add_tag_d` command calls `AddSpecialisationCommandParser#parse(String)` the index argument which is the index of the doctor we are adding the tag into. It also parses the tag argument which contains the specialisation to be added.

**Step 4**: The created `AddSpecialisationCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its `execute` method is called.
`AddSpecialisationCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#setDoctor(Doctor, Doctor)` and with the doctor to update and the doctor with the updated specialisation.

The example usage scenario for the add prescription and add medical condition mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add specialisation operation would work:

![AddSpecialisationSequenceDiagram](images/AddSpecialisationSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for the add prescription and medical condition operations would be similar.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to add a specialisation/medical condition/prescription:

![AddXYZTagActivityDiagram](images/AddXYZTagActivityDiagram.png)

### Delete Specialisation / Medical condition / Prescription feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the delete specialisation/medical condition/prescription features.

#### Implementation
The deletion of a specialisation/medical condition/prescription from MediConnect is facilitated by `LogicManager`. It extends `Logic` and stores the `MediConnectParser` that parses the user input, and the model in which the command is executed. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `LogicManager#execute(String)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Executes the given user String input and returns a `CommandResult`.

These operations are exposed in the `Ui` interface as `MainWindow#executeCommand(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add `Specialisation` mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application. The `Database` will be initialized with all data in the order that it was stored in.

**Step 2**: The user inputs `delete_tag_d 2 t\Orthopaedic` to delete a doctor's specialisation from MediConnect.
The `delete_tag_d` command calls `DeleteSpecialisationCommandParser#parse(String)` which returns the index of the doctor to modify.
A new `DeleteSpecialisationCommand` instance will be created.

**Step 3**: The created `DeleteSpecialisationCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager` and its `execute` method is called.
`DeleteSpecialisationCommand#execute(Model)` then calls `Model#getFilteredDoctorList()` and retrieve the doctor with the given `Index`. 
Then, the specified specialisation will be removed from the doctor if exists and replace the existing doctor in Model with the command of `Model#setDoctor(Doctor, Doctor)`.

The example usage scenario for delete medical condition and delete prescription mechanisms would be similar to the scenario above.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete specialisation operation would work and will be similar to deletion of medical condition and prescription:

![DeleteSpecialisationSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSpecialisationSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to delete a specialisation/medical condition/prescription:

![DeleteXYZTagActivityDiagram](images/DeleteXYZTagActivityDiagram.png)

### View Appointment / Doctor / Patient feature

**Introduction**

This section describes the feature that allows users to view the full details of appointments/doctors/patients in the MediConnect database by index.

#### Implementation

The View Patient mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It extends `Model` and stores the appointment, doctor
and patient to be shown as `selectedAppointment`, `selectedDoctor` and `selectedPatient` respectively. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `ModelManager#getSelectedAppointment()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Returns the Appointment currently selected in the Model.
- `ModelManager#updateSelectedAppointment(Appointment)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Sets the selected Appointment currently in the Model.
- `ModelManager#getSelectedDoctor()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Returns the Doctor currently selected in the Model.
- `ModelManager#updateSelectedDoctor(Doctor)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Sets the selected Doctor currently in the Model.
- `ModelManager#getSelectedPatient()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Returns the Patient currently selected in the Model.
- `ModelManager#updateSelectedPatient(Patient)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Sets the selected Patient currently in the Model.

The getter operations are exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#getSelectedAppointment()`, `Logic#getSelectedDoctor()` and `Logic#getSelectedPatient()`.

It is also facilitated by `AppointmentWindow`, `DoctorWindow` and `PatientWindow` which extend `UiPart`. They are stored in the `MainWindow` and implements the following operations:

- `AppointmentWindow#updateAppointment(Appointment)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Sets the Appointment to be shown in the window.
- `AppointmentWindow#show()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Displays the Appointment Window.
- `AppointmentWindow#focus()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Toggles to the Appointment Window.
- `DoctorWindow#updateDoctor(Doctor)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Sets the Doctor to be shown in the window.
- `DoctorWindow#show()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Displays the Doctor Window.
- `DoctorWindow#focus()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Toggles to the Doctor Window.
- `PatientWindow#updatePatient(Patient)` â€‰â€”â€‰ Sets the Patient to be shown in the window.
- `PatientWindow#show()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Displays the Patient Window.
- `PatientWindow#focus()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Toggles to the Patient Window.

Lastly, it is also facilitated by `CommandResult` which stores the boolean value `showAppointment`, `showDoctor` and `showPatient` and implement the following operations:

- `CommandResult#isShowAppointment()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Indicates if the command is View Appointment.
- `CommandResult#isShowDoctor()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Indicates if the command is View Doctor.
- `CommandResult#isShowPatient()` â€‰â€”â€‰ Indicates if the command is View Patient.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view patient mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**: The user launches the application for the first time. `selectedAppointment`, `selectedDoctor` and `selectedPatient` has not been initialised and `AppointmentWindow`, `DoctorWindow` and `PatientWindow` are closed by default.

**Step 2**: The user executes `view_p 2` command to view the 2nd patient in the patient list. The `view` command calls `ModelManager#updateSelectedPatient(Patient)`, causing the `selectedPatient` to be initialised the 2nd patient in the patient list.
The `CommandResult` returned will call `PatientWindow#updatePatient(Patient)` followed by `PatientWindow#show()`, launching the `PatientWindow` with the details of the 2nd patient.

**Step 3**: The user toggle back to the main window and executes `view_p 4` command to view the 4th patient in the patient list. The `view` command calls `ModelManager#updateSelectedPatient(Patient)`, causing the `selectedPatient` to be updated with the 4th patient in the patient list.
The `CommandResult` returned will call `PatientWindow#updatePatient(Patient)` followed by `PatientWindow#focus()`, toggling to the `PatientWindow` with the details of the 4th patient.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:** If the user decides to close the Patient Window before executing the command, `PatientWindow#focus()` will not be invoked, instead it will invoke `PatientWindow#show()` similar to Step 2.
</div>

The view doctor and view appointment mechanism function similarly by utilising on their respective filtered lists, methods and windows.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How view appointment / doctor / patient executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the selected Patient in the model and retrieve on `CommandResult` instruction.
    * Pros: Straight forward to implement.
    * Cons: Requires extensive additions to the `Model` and `Logic` interface.

* **Alternative 2:** Store selected Patient in `CommandResult` and retrieve directly from there.
    * Pros: No changes to the `Model` and `Logic` interface required.
    * Cons: Reduces `CommandResult` cohesiveness as it will now have the responsibility of passing the selected Patient to the Ui.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

This section covers the list of planned enhancements to address any existing feature flaws.

### Specifying whether the patient or doctor NRIC is invalid when using `add_a` or `edit_a`

Currently, if a user enters an invalid NRIC for either of the parameters `DOCTOR_NRIC` and `PATIENT_NRIC`,
the result box will only state `NRIC should not be blank, should start with 'S', 'T', 'F', 'G' or 'M', contain 7 numbers, and end with a letter`.

For greater clarity and ease of use, we plan to specify which NRIC is the invalid NRIC, so the user would know which NRIC he or she needs to correct.


### Checking if the phone number is a valid Singapore number

Currently, the regex restriction for any phone number enter just needs to be 3 digits or longer and contains no spaces.

Since we are targeting small GP clinics in Singapore, it would be useful if we make the regex ensure that the number entered is a valid Singapore number.
This is done by ensuring the first digit is 6, 8 or 9, and the number entered is exactly 8 digits.

### Limiting the length of the remarks entered and wrapping the remark text

Currently, the length of the remarks entered is not restricted. Should the user decide to enter an extremely long remark,
the view window might truncate the remark, resulting in the user not being able to view the full remark.

To overcome this, we proposed to wrap the text of remark in the view window, so instead of the text getting truncated, it
will continue on the next line. Since we also intended for remarks to be a short note initially, we would like to restrict
the maximum characters entered for a remark to be 100 characters.

### Checking for repeated parameters in the edit remark features

Currently, the edit remark features for appointment, doctor and patient accepts repeated parameters with the prefix `r\ `.
Only the last supplied parameter is taken as the new remark while the others are all ignored.

Since there can only be 1 remark for each appointment/doctor/patient, it would be useful to limit the command to only accept 1 new remark.
This is done by checking for multiple occurrences of `r\ ` and displaying an error message if there are more than 1.

### Making medical conditions/prescriptions/specialisations case-insensitive

Currently, in MediConnect, medical conditions/prescriptions/specialisations are case-sensitive. For example, if patient `John Doe` has the medical condition `depression`,
adding a medical condition `Depression` to `John Doe` would not cause any errors. 

To enhance usability, it would be useful if the medical conditions/prescriptions/specialisations are treated in a case-insensitive manner. This can be done by converting each medical condition/specialisation/prescription
to lowercase first before checking for duplicates.

### Making the View window update whenever there is a change in details of the appointment/doctor/patient

Currently, when an appointment/doctor/patient is displayed in the View window and the user updates any of its fields, the details on the View window does not update instantly unless the user type the View command again.

To improve the user experience, we plan to make MediConnect automatically update the details on the View window should there be any new changes made. 
This can be done by making the `selectedAppointment`, `selectedDoctor` and `selectedAppointment` observable, whenever there is a change in the details of the selected entity, the `Ui` will be able to update accordingly.
