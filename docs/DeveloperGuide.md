--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Introduction

### **1.1. Product Overview**
ProjectPro is a contacts organisation application designed for university students.

University students often spend a lot of time coordinating project meetup sessions and finding project information, resulting in large amounts of time wasted.

This app can help to save time by:
* listing available time slots of individuals in a team.
* Finding common time slots for meetings.
* Saving extra information regarding a project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.2 Setting up getting started

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.3 Acknowledgements

ProjectPro is a brownfield Java Project based on the AB3 project template created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

## 2 Design

### 2.1 Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**2.1.1. Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two main classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.



The rest of the App consists of these main four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

On the other hand, [**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**2.1.2. How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Alex`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

`GroupTimeContainer` is a helper class that process the data from the `model` in `Calendar` and passes the processed data to `DayCard` which will be then displayed in the `UI`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### 2.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete n/Alex")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/Alex` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it calls the `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`), being executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command calls upon `Model` to execute the action (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back to `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 2.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### 2.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

With the inclusion of `Group` and `TimeIntervals` in our application, more components had to be saved by our storage.

To address this requirement, we updated our storage to save both classes in JSON format.

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3 Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1 Adding a Person

#### Implementation

The `add` feature is facilitated by a number of classes such as `Person` and `Model`

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `“add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com g/CS2103T”` command to add a new person.

Step 3, The `AddCommandParser` is called to read the user input. `AddCommandParser` parses the input and calls `AddCommand`.

Step.4 `AddCommand` then calls `Model#addPerson()` which then calls `AddressBook#addPerson()`. The latter method will add person inside the `uniquePersonList` in `addressBook`. `AddCommand` also calls `Model#addGroup` which then calls `AddressBook#addGroup` to add the group inside `grouplist` if the group does not exist. Lastly, `AddCommand` adds the person inside the group

**Note** No duplication is allowed in addressbook for name, email and phone number field.

The following sequence diagram describes the process of `add` command:
<puml src="diagrams/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddCommandSeqDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Handling group attribute in user input**

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Only allow user to add one group for each `add` Command
  * Pros: User input length is reduced, lowering the chance of invalid input on the user's side.
  * Cons: User will have to type more inputs to add more groups.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow user to add as many groups as required for each `add` Command
  * Pros: Conveniently adds a person into multiple group while creating a new contact at the same time.
  * Cons: User input can get potentially very long, increasing the chance of invalid input, relatively harder to implement parser. The implementation of it will get more complex.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.2 Adding a Group

#### Proposed Implementation

The Add Group mechanism is facilitated by `Group` class. This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addGroup()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group creation mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:** User launches the application.

**Step 2:** The user executes `new g/GROUPNAME` to create a new group with the name GROUPNAME. `CreateGroupCommandParser` parses the GROUPNAME, ensuring the input is valid, and creates a `CreateGroupCommand`, which calls `Model#addGroup()`. The model retrieves the existing groupList from the addressBook and adds this new group to the groupList.

**Note:** ProjectPRO does not allow 2 groups of the same name to be added. The group name must also be alphanumerical and non empty.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
<puml src="diagrams/CreateGroupActivityDiagram.puml" alt="CreateGroupActivityDiagram"/>

Below is a sequence diagram that summarizes how a user creates a new group:
<puml src="diagrams/CreateGroupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CreateGroupSequenceDiagram"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `CreateGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Groups with the same name**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Group names are Unique
  * Pros: Allow users to create groups with the same name
  * Cons: User might have to be creative with naming groups

* **Alternative 2:** Group names are not unique but tagged with an id
  * Pros: Users can reuse commonly used group names
  * Cons: Users may get confused as to what each group is meant for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.3 Delete Person and Group

#### Implementation

The Delete person/group mechanisms are facilitated by `Model` class, which accesses the `AddressBook` class. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#removePerson(Person p)` — Removes Person p from the address book.
* `AddressBook#removeGroup(Group g)` — Removes Group g from the address book.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deletePerson()`, `Model#deleteGroup()` respectively.

Both `DeletePersonCommand` and `DeleteGroupCommand` implement an abstract class `DeleteCommand`, which helps to encapsulate the similarities between these two commands.

Since both Delete Person and Delete Group commands utilise the same command word, the `DeleteCommandParser` will create either a `DeletePersonCommand` or  `DeleteGroupCommand` and return it as a `DeleteCommand` after parsing the user input.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete command:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteCommandActivity" />

### Delete Person

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Delete Person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `delete n/Alex Yeoh` command to delete a person named 'Alex Yeoh' in the contact list. After parsing, a new `DeletePersonCommand` object will be returned.

Step 2. `DeletePersonCommand` is executed, in which `Model#deletePerson("Alex Yeoh")` is called.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If no such person named 'Alex Yeoh' exists, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

</box>

Step 3. `Model#deletePerson()` will also call `AddressBook#removePerson(Alex Yeoh)` which will remove the target contact from the contact list while removing it from all the groups it was part of by calling `Group#removePerson(Alex Yeoh)`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Delete Person operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeletePersonSequence" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

### Delete Group

The Delete Group command mechanism behaves the same as the Delete Person command above, except it deletes the target `Group` object instead of the `Person` object.

Additionally, `AddressBook#removeGroup(Group g)` will remove the target group 'g' from the group lists of all the members that were a part of it by calling `Person#removeGroup(Group g)`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How to handle two similar but different commands (delete group and delete person)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same command word
  * Pros: Reduces the amount of command words that users have to remember
  * Cons: Users may get confused because one command word can be used for different things

* **Alternative 2:** Use different command words for both commands
  * Pros: Less confusing as it is intuitive that different command words are used for different commands
  * Cons: Users have to remember more command words which may take more time to get used to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 3.4 List Person and list group

### List-Person

The List mechanism is facilitated by the `Model` class.

The operation it utilises is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:** User executes `list` command to view all contacts. After parsing, a new `ListCommand` object will be returned.

**Step 2:** `ListCommand` is executed, in which `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` is called with the Predicate<Person> which will be true for all contacts. This updates the address book view, showing all the contacts in the address book to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:

<puml src="diagrams/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ListCommandSequence" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ListCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>


#### List Group

The List Group mechanism is facilitated by the `Model` class.

The operation it utilises is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFilteredGroupList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listgroup mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:** User executes `listgroup` command to view all groups in their contact list. After parsing, a new `ListGroupCommand` object will be returned.

**Step 2:** `ListGroupCommand` is executed, in which `Model#getFilteredGroupList()` is called, returning all the groups the user has in the contact list.

**Step 3:** The group names of all the groups in the contact list are appended to a `String` which will be displayed to the user as a message in the output box.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a listgroup command:

<puml src="diagrams/ListGroupSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ListGroupSequence" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ListGroupCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.5 Find Person and Find Group features

#### Implementation

The Find person/group mechanisms are facilitated by the `Model` class.

The operation they utilise is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)`.

Both `FindPersonCommand` and `FindGroupCommand` implement an abstract class `FindCommand`, which helps to encapsulate the similarities between these two commands.

Since both Find Person and Find Group commands utilise the same command word, the `FindCommandParser` will create either a `FindPersonCommand` or  `FindGroupCommand` and return it as a `FindCommand` after parsing the user input.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

<puml src="diagrams/FindCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindCommandActivity" />

### Find Person

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find Person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find n/Alex John` command to find all contacts whose names contain either 'Alex' or 'John' in the address book. After parsing, a new `FindPersonCommand` object will be returned along with the corresponding `Predicate<Person>`.

Step 2. `FindPersonCommand` is executed, in which `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called with the Predicate<Person>. This through all the contacts in the address book, showing the updated list of contacts whose names start with 'Alex' or 'John' to the user.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If there are no contacts whose name contains 'Alex, or 'John', no contacts will be shown.

</box>


The following sequence diagram shows how the Find Person operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindPersonSequence" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

### Find Group

The Find Group mechanism works like the Find Person mechanism, expect it filters contacts by a different `Predicate<Person>` which will filter for contacts who are a part of the target group.

Additionally, it calls on an extra method `Group#getGroupRemark()`. `Group#getGroupRemarks()` will be called to display the previously saved group remarks to the user.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How to handle two similar but different commands (find by group and find by name)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same command word
  * Pros: Reduces the amount of command words that users have to remember
  * Cons: Users may get confused because one command word can be used for different things

* **Alternative 2:** Use different command words for both commands
  * Pros: Less confusing as it is intuitive that different command words are used for different commands
  * Cons: Users have to remember more command words which may take more time to get used to

**Aspect: Case-sensitivity for find by name**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Not case-sensitive
  * Pros: Fulfils its functionality better as users can search freely for their contacts even if they do not remember the exact name their contacts were saved under
  * Cons: Users may get confused because aside from find by name, other user inputs are all case-sensitive

* **Alternative 2:** Case sensitive
  * Pros: Less confusing as it is more intuitive that all user inputs are case-sensitive, and users will be able to find specific contacts easily if they remember how exactly they were saved by
  * Cons: Might hinder some more forgetful users from finding their contacts in mind if they do not remember how they capitalised their contacts when adding them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.6 Group and Ungrouping Person

#### Implementation

The group mechanism is facilitated by `Group`. It is stored internally as a `Group`. This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#groupPerson(personName, groupName)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:** User launches the application.

**Step 2:** The user executes `group n/personName g/groupName` to group a person `personName` into group `groupName`. `

**Step 3.** GroupPersonCommandParser` parses the personName and groupName ensuring the input is valid and creates a `GroupPersonCommand`

**Step 4.** GroupPersonCommand calls `Model#groupPerson(personName, groupName)`. The model retrieves the existing person and group from the addressBook.

**Step 5.** Model calls `Model#assignGroup(Person person, Group group)` which adds a group to a person's groupList and person to the personList in group.

**Note:** Should a person or group not exist, an error is thrown, displaying the missing entity to the User.

Ungroup works in the same way as group except the use of Command word ungroup

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
<puml src="diagrams/GroupPersonActivityDiagram.puml" alt="GroupPersonActivityDiagram"/>

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Whether to store references in both person and group**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store references in both person and group
  * Pros: Easy to implement. More efficient when searching.
  * Cons: More bug-prone. May have object referencing and loading from storage issues as both the person reference to group, and group reference to person has to be loaded properly.

* **Alternative 2:** Store reference to the other entity, e.g. store a list of groups in person.
  * Pros: Easier to load from storage. One centralized place to store data. Less coupling.
  * Cons: Searching might become more costly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.7 Adding a Group Remark

#### Implementation

The Group Remark mechanism is facilitated by the `Group Remark` class, involving other classes like `Group`. It implements the following operation:

* `Group#setGroupRemark()` — Sets the group's remark.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addGroupRemark()`.

Here's an example usage scenario and how the group remark mechanism behaves at each step:

**Step 1.** The user creates a group called "CS2103T". The group is initialized with an empty `groupRemark`.

**Step 2.** The user executes the `remark g/CS2103T r/Quiz tomorrow` command to add the remark "Quiz tomorrow" to the "CS2103T" group. The `GroupRemarkCommandParser` extracts the group and remark from the input and creates a `GroupRemarkCommand`, which calls `Model#addGroupRemark(groupName, groupRemark)`. The model retrieves the existing "CS2103T" group from the database and calls the group's `Group#setGroupRemark(groupRemark)`, setting the "Quiz tomorrow" as the `groupRemark` of the group.

**Note:** If the user wants to modify the group remark, they can execute the same command with the new remark. The existing remark will be overwritten, and the new remark is stored in the group.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/GroupRemarkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="GroupRemarkSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `GroupRemarkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspects: How to change the group remark**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Override the original remark
  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May be troublesome if the user wants to keep contents from the original remark.

- **Alternative 2:** Edit the original remark
  - Pros: Easy to add more information.
  - Cons: May be confusing to edit if there are many changes or remark is too long.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.8 Adding Time to a Person or Group

#### Implementation

The Add Time to person/group mechanisms are facilitated by the `TimeInterval` class, involving other classes like `Person` and `Group`. It implements the following operations:

* `Person#addFreeTime()` — Adds the inputted time intervals to the person.
* `Group#addTime()` — Adds the inputted time intervals to the group.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTimeToPerson()`, `Model#addTimeToGroup()` respectively.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add time command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddTimeActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddTimeActivity" />

### Adding Time to a Person

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Add Time to Person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addtime n/Alex Yeoh t/mon 1300 - mon 1400 t/tue 1300 - tue 1400` command to add the free time intervals of Monday 1 pm to 2 pm and Tuesday 1 pm to 2 pm to a person named "Alex Yeoh" in the contact list. The `AddTimeCommandParser` will be called to parse the inputs and check if any of the inputted times clash with each other. It will then call the `AddTimeCommand`.

**Note:** Since multiple inputs are allowed, an array list of time intervals is passed around, each of which is to be added.

Step 2. `AddTimeCommand` is executed, in which `Model#addTimeToPerson()` is called.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If no such person named "Alex Yeoh" exists, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

</box>

Step 3. `Model#addTimeToPerson()` will also call `Person#addFreeTime()` which will add all times stored in the array list to the person's list of free times, given that none of the times clash with the person's existing free time intervals. If clashes do occur, the user will be notified of the problematic time intervals while the problem-free intervals will be added.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Add Time to Person operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddTimeSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddTimeSequence" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddTimeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

### Adding Time to a Group

The Add Time to Group command mechanism behaves the same as the Add Time to Person command above, except it uses the `Group` class instead of the `Person` class.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to handle two similar but different commands (add meeting time to group and add free time to person)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use different command words for both commands
  * Pros: Less confusing as the 2 commands add different types of times.
  * Cons: Users have to remember more command words which may take more time to get used to.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the same command word
  * Pros: Reduces the amount of command words that users have to remember.
  * Cons: Users may get confused because the 2 commands do not add the same types of times.

**Aspect: How to handle time clashes**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add all non-clashing time intervals
  * Pros: More convenient as users will not need to retype the entire command if there is a clash.
  * Cons: May no longer want to add certain non-clashing inputs after encountering this clash.

* **Alternative 2:** Reject all time intervals
  * Pros: Allows users to (heavily) edit their inputted time intervals accordingly to resolve clashes.
  * Cons: May be troublesome to retype the entire command, especially if it is very long.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.9 Delete Time Feature

#### Implementation

The Delete Time from person/group mechanisms are facilitated by the `TimeInterval` class, involving other classes like `Person` and `Group`. It implements the following operations:

* `Person#deleteFreeTime()` — Deletes the inputted time intervals from the person.
* `Group#deleteTime()` — Deletes the inputted time intervals from the group.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteTimeFromPerson()`, `Model#deleteTimeFromGroup()` respectively.

Below is an activity diagram that illustrates the control flow for Delete Person Time feature.

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePersonTimeActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeletePersonTimeActivityDiagram"/>

### Deleting Time from a Person

The proposed delete time feature is facilitated by the `timeIntervalList` and `Person` class. It accesses the `timeIntervalList` from the `Person` class and deletes a time interval with `Person#deleteFreeTime()`. The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteTimeFromPerson`.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the free time of its contacts.

Step 2. The user executes the command `deleteTime n/Alex Yeoh t/mon 1200 - mon 1400 t/tue 1000 - wed 1600`. The `deleteTimeCommandParser` will be called to parse the inputs and call the `deletePersonTimeCommand`. The `deletePersonTime` command calls `Model#deleteTimeFromPerson()`, which will call `Person#deleteFreeTime()`.

**Note:** Since multiple inputs are allowed, an array list of time intervals are passed around, each of which is to be deleted.

Step 3. The function will be called in the person's `timeInterval` list. The application will loop through each time interval that is to be deleted and in the person's `timeInterval` list. Each time interval will be compared to see whether the `timeIntervalList` contains the time interval to be deleted. Afterwards, the new `timeInterval` list will be saved.

**Note:** If a time interval is not in the person's list, that interval will be collated and printed to specifically notify the user which time intervals are not in the list. The other time intervals that are in the list will still be deleted.

### Deleting Time from a Group

The Delete Time from Group command mechanism behaves the same as the Delete Time from Person command above, except it uses the `Group` class instead of the `Person` class.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Error Messages**

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Print specific error messages.
  * Pros: Allow users to understand which inputs went wrong.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of runtime as more functions will be used to craft the error message. Currently, we utilized a `StringBuilder` to craft the message and did extra checks to see whether there had been any errors appended to the error message.

* Alternative 2: Generalized error message.
  * Pros: Will be faster to implement.
  * Cons: User might be unsure why the function went wrong.

**Aspect: How to Handle Multiple Time Inputs**

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Parse each time input one by one and execute the commands.
  * Pros: More user-friendly and efficient as users can delete more time intervals at once.
  * Cons: More expensive as more functions will be called to parse the inputs.

* Alternative 2: Allow only single input.
  * Pros: Faster as fewer functions are called.
  * Cons: Not as user-friendly since users will have to delete time intervals one by one.

**Aspect: How to Handle Errors in Time Intervals**

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Delete the time intervals that are correct and return the intervals that are wrong.
  Pros: Better user experience as users need not rewrite intervals that were right.
  Cons: Increased memory usage to store the errors.

* Alternative 2: Do not carry out the delete at all.
  Pros: More time and memory efficient.
  Cons: Not as user-friendly since users will have to re-input the time intervals that were originally correct.

### 3.10 Listing Time for a Person or Group

#### Implementation

The List Time for person/group mechanisms are facilitated by the `TimeInterval` class, involving other classes like `Person` and `Group`. It implements the following operations:

* `Person#getTime()` — Shows the person's time intervals.
* `Group#getTime()` — Shows the group's time intervals.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getTimeFromPerson()`, `Model#getTimeFromGroup()` respectively.

Both `ListTimePersonCommand` and `ListTimeGroupCommand` implement an abstract class `ListTimeCommand`, which helps to encapsulate the similarities between these two commands.

Since both List Time Person and List Time Group commands utilise the same command word `listtime`, the `ListTimeCommandParser` will create either a `ListTimePersonCommand` or  `ListTimeGroupCommand` and return it as a `ListTimeCommand` after parsing the user input.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add time command:

<puml src="diagrams/ListTimeActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ListTimeActivity" />

### Listing Time from a Person

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the List Time from Person mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `listtime n/Alex Yeoh` command to list the free time intervals of a person named "Alex Yeoh" in the contact list. The `ListTimeCommandParser` will be called to parse the inputs. It will then call the `ListTimePersonCommand`.

Step 2. `ListTimePersonCommand` is executed, in which `Model#getTimeFromPerson()` is called.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If no such person named "Alex Yeoh" exists, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

</box>

Step 3. `Model#getTimeFromPerson()` will also call `Person#getTime()` which will parse all times stored in the array list into an easy-to-read chunk using a StringBuilder, and show it in the output box.

The following sequence diagram shows how the List Time from Person operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/ListTimePersonSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ListTimePersonSequence" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ListTimeCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

### Listing Time from a Group

The List Time from Group command mechanism behaves the same as the List Time from Person command above, except it uses the `Group` class instead of the `Person` class.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to handle two similar but different commands (add meeting time to group and add free time to person)**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use different command words for both commands
  * Pros: Less confusing as the 2 commands add different types of times.
  * Cons: Users have to remember more command words which may take more time to get used to.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the same command word
  * Pros: Reduces the amount of command words that users have to remember.
  * Cons: Users may get confused because the 2 commands do not add the same types of times.

**Aspect: Display format**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Print raw list of times
  * Pros: Allows users to copy and paste the intervals shown as they are in the correct format.
  * Cons: May be too convoluted due to repeated information caused by reiterating the day of the time interval.

* **Alternative 2:** Organise time intervals by day.
  * Pros: Allows users to better see the intervals in each day.
  * Cons: May cause inconvenience to users when they need to copy and paste time chunks should they need it again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.11 Find Free Time
#### Implementation

The FindFreeTime mechanism is facilitated by the `Model`, `Group` and  `Person` class. It retrieves `Group` from `Model` to find a free time between group members in `listOfGroupMates` in `Group` with a duration specified, `Duration`. The operation is exposed to `Model` interface as `Model#findGroup`.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:** User launches the application.
**Step 2:** User executes `findfreetime g/CS2103 d/60` command to find a common meeting time with duration 60 minutes for group CS2103.
**Step 3:** FindFreeTimeCommandParser parses the group name CS2103 and duration 60, ensuring that duration is a valid integer in terms of minutes, and returns a FindFreeTimeCommand.
**Step 4:** FindFreeTimeCommand calls `Model#findGroup(groupName)` to retrieve the group with matching name. If group does not exist, then an error is thrown.
**Step 4:** FindFreeTimeCommand calls `Group#findFreeTime(duration)`, to retrieve the all common timeslots between `listOfGroupMates` in `Group` and return them in a list should they accommodate the duration stated.
**Note:**
If group is empty, having no group mates in `listOfGroupMates` an error is thrown. If any group mate has not key in their free time slots using `addtime`, an error is thrown. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a FindFreeTime command:
<puml src="diagrams/FindFreeTimeActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindFreeTimeActivityDiagram" />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4 Planned Enhancements

### 4.1 Undo/redo feature

Currently, we do not have undo and redo feature which open rooms for users to accidentally have typos in their command messages, causing certain unwanted commands to be executed. This can cause an array of problems,
from deleting important data along with the contact, to inconvenience for the users themselves. As such, we plan to implement undo and redo feature in the future to provide a better user experience for our users.

### 4.2. `addtime`/`deletetime` feature

Currently, our add and delete time features allow users to input multiple time slots in the command box. Should a certain input encounter an error (clashing time intervals), ProjectPRO adds / deletes the other time intervals that are valid and clears the command box. We recognise that users might encounter accidental typos while typing time intervals. Hence, we plan to disallow the clearing command box when the user typed an invalid input.

### 4.3. Improving our user interface.

Currently, ProjectPRO's output box height is relative short which could lead to user frustration and hindered efficiency. Users may find it challenging to quickly interpret and comprehend the output, especially when certain commands generate outputs with numerous lines. This limitation might result in a suboptimal user experience, making it difficult for users to extract the desired information promptly.Addressing this problem is crucial to ensuring a more user-friendly interface and improving the overall effectiveness of ProjectPRO for its users. Our future implementation involves optimizing the output display by increasing the height of the output box. This enhancement aims to provide users with a more comprehensive and visually accessible view, allowing them to easily grasp the content at a glance.

### 4.4. Allowing extensive modification to command words.

As ProjectPro is a CLI text-based application, it requires extensive typing which might prove troublesome at times. As a result, our users would naturally have their personal preferences regarding the command word inputs.
Enabling users to customize input requirements for functions within ProjectPRO would significantly enhance the flexibility and adaptability of the system. This future implementation empowers users by allowing them to tailor input parameters based on their specific needs and preferences. By accommodating a range of input variations, users can streamline their workflows and optimize the tool to align with diverse use cases.

### 4.5 Improving `addmeeting` feature.

In the `addmeeting` feature, user can add free time intervals to a group. Currently, user can add same free time intervals for 2 separate groups or overlapping time intervals between 2 or more groups, causing a clash in their schedule. (Eg. `Group A: Mon 1200 - Mon 1400`; `Group B: Mon 1300 - Mon 1500`). These clashes are not detected and will allow this state to exist. We plan to not allow this, so user cannot insert time intervals that are overlapping with other groups. Eg. `Group A: Mon 1200 - Mon 1400`; `Group B: Mon 1300 - Mon 1500` will not be allowed.

## 8 Appendix Effort 

ProjectPRO is a project built upon AB3, which was built out of the SE-EDU initiative. Our group has been actively working on ProjectPRO this semester, meeting regularly to discuss about our application to meet deadlines punctually.


In this section, we will detail some challenges we faced throughout the process of creating ProjectPRO.

### **8.1 Design Challenges**
As ProjectPRO is a brownfield project built from AB3, it was necessary to identify the pros and cons of AB3, and use them to come up with a better application more suited for university students. Some challenges include:
* Designing a nice user interface with JavaFX: One big change we wanted to incorporate into our application was the change of the User Interface. We wanted a more lively colour scheme to make our product not only convenient, but pretty to create a better user experience. Despite not being fluent in JavaFX, we trialed around with colours and different components and eventually created a mini weekly calendar to document our weekly group meetings, while having a warm colour scheme to make our application enticing to users.
* Creating more relevant functions and fields for university students: Since our application targeted University students, we decided to add group fields to allow students to record who is in their group. After identifying finding meeting time as a common problem faced by university students in group projects, we also added a time field and added functions to help find common free times that groupmates are free to help users better find common free time to hold meetings.

### **8.1 Design Challenges**
* Given the substantial size of AB3, comprehending its code structure and intricacies posed an initial challenge for us. In response, we proactively initiated project meetings early on. This early engagement provided us with additional time to grasp the intricacies of AB3's implementation and facilitated collaborative discussions to clarify any uncertainties we had about AB3. This enhanced understanding played a crucial role in minimizing the learning curve when undertaking the implementation of new features for ProjectPRO. Since some features shared similar concepts, understanding how they were implemented in AB3 significantly eased the difficulty in implementing corresponding methods for ProjectPRO's enhancements.
