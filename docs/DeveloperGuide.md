## **Acknowledgements**

Staff-Snap is based on the [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) project created by
the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org), and it incorporates the following third-party
libraries: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/), [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/project-info.html), [TestFX](https://testfx.github.io/TestFX/docs/javadoc/testfx-core/javadoc/org.testfx/module-summary.html).

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>
Note: The lifeline for <code>DeleteCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ApplicantBookParser` object which in turn
   creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ApplicantBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ApplicantBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the applicant book data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound
  to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both applicant book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `ApplicantBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.staffsnap.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<br>

### Add applicant feature

#### Implementation

The add applicant feature allows users to add an applicant to the applicant list.

#### Steps to trigger

1. The user launches the application.
2. The user executes `add n/John Doe hp/98765432 e/jd@gmail.com p/software engineer` to add a new applicant.
3. The `AddCommandParser#parse()` checks whether all the prefixes and the required values are provided.
4. If the check is successful, the `AddCommand#execute()` checks if the applicant exists in the applicant list.
5. If the applicant does not exist, the `Model#addApplicant()` adds the applicant to the applicant list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `add` command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: Format for adding applicants and interviews

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Separate command `add` and `addi` for adding applicants and interviews respectively.
    - Pros: Shorter command for user and easier to handle exceptions.
    - Cons: Harder to implement.

- Alternative 2: Same command `add` for adding applicants and interviews.
    - Pros: More convenient for user to add an applicant with interviews.
    - Cons: Still necessary to have a separate `addi` command for user to add a new interview to an existing applicant.

<br>

---
<br>

### Edit applicant feature

#### Implementation

The edit applicant feature allows users to edit the details of an applicant.

#### Steps to trigger

1. The user launches the application.
2. The user executes `edit 1 hp/87654321 p/front-end engineer` to edit the phone number and position of the first
   applicant.
3. The `EditCommandParser#parse()` checks whether the index of the applicant is valid and at least one prefix with the
   required values are provided.
4. If the check is successful, the `EditCommand#execute()` checks if the identity of the applicant after the edit is the
   same as the identity of another existing applicant.
5. If the identity is not the same, the `Model#setApplicant()` updates the details of the applicant while
   the `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` updates applicant list to display the updated applicant list.

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: Syntax for editing applicants

- Alternative 1 (current choice): At least one field to edit has to be provided.
    - Pros: More convenient for user to edit an applicant's details and shorter command. Ensures that field not meant to
      be edited will remain unchanged.
    - Cons: Harder to implement due to more validation and checks needed.

- Alternative 2:  All fields of the applicant has to be provided, regardless of whether it is edited.
    - Pros: Easier to implement due to similarity to add feature.
    - Cons: More areas for error as fields not meant to be edited might be edited due to a typo.

<br>

---
<br>

### Help feature

#### Implementation

1. When the user enters the term help. it triggers the help feature in the parser under the switch case.
2. After it is triggered, it will display a short list of possible commands that the user can use.
3. The user guide will also be opened in their browser

#### Steps to trigger

1. User opens the app.
2. User keys in `help`.
3. Command list is shown and opens user guide in browser.

#### Notes

1. Help can be called anytime and has no format to follow. The popup screen is disabled to avoid confusion but can be
   enabled in the future if need be.

<br>

---
<br>

### Confirmation + Clear command

#### Implementation

1. This features requires the state of the parser to be known.
2. The parser is modified to store the previous taken in command, in this case whether the previous command was a
   successful clear command.
3. If the previous command is not a clear command, it looks for the keyword clear. Otherwise, it looks for the keyword
   yes.
4. Hence, the user will first need to call clear, before calling yes to invoke the clear mechanism, ensuring safety of
   data.

#### Steps to trigger

1. User opens the app.
2. User enters `clear` (and subsequently sees a message asking to confirm).
3. User enters `yes` to confirm the clear.

#### Notes

1. If you would like to extend the code for more features that require state, please do change the case condition for
   this feature.
2. Currently, it follows the default commands if a word other than yes is given. But this will be improved in a future
   update.
3. The state of the parser, rather than the app is used to reduce the chances of accidental clears.

<br>

<br>

### Interview feature

#### Purpose

As a hiring management software, we need to perform CRUD operations for the interviews of applicants. This allows us to
add new interviews, view existing interviews, edit current interviews, and delete interviews. As we aim so make our
program intuitive and efficient, the UI design and data structure used to store these interview objects were crucial
considerations in the implementation process.

#### Implementation

The `Interview` class is used to store the information of each interview. It contains the following attributes: `type`
and `rating`. The `type` attribute represents the type of interview, while the `rating` attribute represents how well
the applicant performed in an interview (out of a score of 10). The CRUD commands involving `Interview` includes
the `AddInterviewCommand`, `EditInterviewCommand`, and `DeleteInterviewCommand`. These are implemented in a largely
similar manner to the `Applicant` class. The main difference is in how an `EditInterviewDescriptor` class facilitates
the editing of an interview and how the edit and delete commands requires 2 indices: the applicant index as well as the
chosen interview index.

The activity diagram below gives an overview of the behavior when the `DeleteInterviewCommand` is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteInterviewActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteInterviewActivityDiagram" />

#### Design Considerations

In deciding the data structure to house our Interview objects, we were torn between using a `PriorityQueue` and
a `List`. A `PriorityQueue` would have been useful in sorting the interviews by rating, but it would have been difficult
to implement the `EditInterviewCommand` and `DeleteInterviewCommand` as the `PriorityQueue` does not have a `get()`
method. Also, if we wanted to extend a sorting function for interviews in the future, a `PriorityQueue` would make it
more difficult for us to change the comparator for `Interview` objects. For the sake of extensibility of the codebase,
we decided to use a `List` instead. This is because a `List` provides us with greater abstraction and code flexibility
in extending various functions for the `Interview` class.

<br>

---
<br>

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort feature is facilitated by `Descriptor`, an enumeration which describes the valid fields which can be used to
sort an applicant.

To enable sorting, `Applicant` implements `Comparable<Applicant>`, to allow for comparison between applicants. To allow
for applicants to be sorted by different descriptors, `Applicant` is augmented to contain a static `descriptor` field.
This is used in `Applicant#compareTo()`, where a switch case checking the state of the `Descriptor` field will then
compare the specified field of both applicants.

In order to enable comparison of each valid field, these fields will implement the `Comparable` interface. Currently
valid fields for sorting are

1. Name
2. Phone
3. Score
4. Email
5. Position
6. Status

Additionally, a static boolean `Applicant#isDescendingOrder` has been added to keep track of the order to sort the
applicants.

#### Steps to trigger

1. User opens the app.
2. User enters `sort d/ [valid field] [dsc/]`, where valid field is one of the fields listed above to be sorted by.
3. The `SortCommandParser#parse()` checks that the field input is valid and if the `dsc/` flag has been entered to sort
   in descending order.
4. If the input is valid, `SortCommand#execute()` updates both the `descriptor` and `isDescendingOrder` fields of
   the `Applicant` class.
5. The GUI will update and refresh the applicant list to be sorted by the specified field.

The following diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a Sort command:
<puml src="diagrams/SortCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SortCommandActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to compare applicants

- Alternative 1 (current choice): use Comparable interface
    - Pros: Standard method of comparison between objects in Java and implementing it will make it compatible with most
      other sorting functions in Java. Easily extensible by adding more cases to the switch statement, to compare by
      other fields when it becomes supported.
    - Cons: Applicant#compareTo has to return different values depending on which descriptor has been chosen, causing
      some bugs when working with other Java functions as the order of Objects compared to each other is not meant to
      change during runtime.

##### Aspect: Command syntax

- Alternative 1: `sort d/ [valid field]`
    - Pros: Simple and minimal text fields, with a single prefix required to enable sorting.
    - Cons: Only able to sort in ascending order.
- Alternative 2: `sort d/ [valid field] [asc/]/[dsc/]`
    - Pros: Able to sort in either ascending or descending order.
    - Cons: Requires additional input from the user, slowing down the use of the command.
- Alternative 3 (current choice): `sort d/ [valid field] [dsc/]` where `dsc/` is optional
    - Pros: Retains the ability to sort in either order, but also the conciseness of Alternative 1. Also does not
      require user to type in any flag to sort in ascending order.
    - Cons: Users who are not aware of the `dsc/` feature may not use it.

<br>

---
<br>

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The filter feature works by updating the `Predicate` used in the `FilteredList<Applicant>` of `ModelManager`. Using the
predicate, minimal changes to the implementation of StaffSnap is required.

To create a single predicate that is able to search and filter for multiple fields, a `CustomFilterPredicate` class is
created. It currently contains the following fields and is able to filter for applicants which match all specified
fields.

1. Name
2. Phone
3. Email
4. Position
5. Status
6. Less than score
7. Greater than score

When `CustomFilterPredicate#test()` is called, it will check if the specified fields are a substring of the same field
of
the applicant, returning true if all specified fields match, and false otherwise.

#### Steps to trigger

1. User opens the app.
2. User enters `filter [n/, e/, p/, hp/, s/, lts/, gts/] [term]`, where at least one or more of the prefixes is
   specified to
   be filtered by.
3. The `FilterCommandParser#parse()` checks that all entered fields are valid and creates a new `CustomFilterPredicate`
   with all the specified fields.
4. If fields are valid, `FilterCommand#execute()` takes in the `CustomFilterPredicate` and uses it to replace the
   current predicate in `ModelManager` via `ModelManager#updateFilteredApplicantList()`.
5. The GUI will update and refresh the applicant list with only applicants which match all specified fields.

The following diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a Filter command:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FilterCommandActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to filter applicants

- Alternative 1 (current choice): use a custom predicate and FilteredList, **compare using strings**
    - Pros: Current implementation of ModelManager already uses FilteredList, making a custom predicate an easy
      extension.
      The `CustomFilterPredicate` can easily be extended when more applicant fields are ready to expand the utility of
      the
      filter command.
    - Cons: Comparison of predicate fields to applicant fields are done using string comparison.
- Alternative 2: use a custom predicate and FilteredList, **compare within field classes**
    - Pros: Same as alternative 1, and definition of what is considered a match can be defined in the field class (e.g.
      Name, Phone, etc).
    - Cons: Will require greater complexity than alternative 1 in implementation. May be slower to integrate new classes
      in the future.

##### Aspect: Command syntax

- Alternative 1: `filter n/ [Name] e/ [Email] p/ [Position] hp/ [Phone] s/ [Status] lts/ [Score] gts/ [Score]`
    - Pros: Unambiguous and forces all fields to be entered, preventing errors.
    - Cons: Users cannot filter by single fields. Requires more key presses to enter a filter command.
- Alternative 2: `filter [n/, e/, p/, hp/, s/, lts/, gts/] [term]`, where only one term is allowed
    - Pros: Quicker to key in command than alternative 1.
    - Cons: Only allows users to filter by one field at a time, limiting utility of filter command.
- Alternative 3 (current choice): `filter [n/, e/, p/, hp/, s/, lts/, gts/] [term]`, where at least one term is required
  and the others are optional
    - Pros: Provides flexibility in the filter command to filter by one or more fields, while still retaining the speed
      of alternative 2 when few fields are required.
    - Cons: Unfamiliar users may not know that fields can be optional anc continue to key in the full command at all
      times.

<br>

### Find feature

#### Purpose

The find feature allows HR managers to find applicants by name, allowing for a faster and more efficient way of
finding and tracking specific candidates.

#### Implementation

After the user enters the find command in the format `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`,
the input is passed to the `ApplicantBookParser` class which calls `FindCommandParser#parse()` which parses the keywords
in the input and creates a list of keywords.

`FindCommandParser` then creates a new instance of `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` with this list of keywords.
This `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is then used as the parameter to instantiate a new `FindComand` object.
`LogicManager#execute()` then calls `FindCommand#execute()` and the current applicant book is updated by calling
`ModelManager#updateFilteredApplicantList()` which checks which applicant's name contains any of the keywords.

An instance of `CommandResult` is then created which contains the message and information that will be displayed to the
user.
The GUI then updates to show this information to the user.

<puml src="diagrams/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindCommandSequenceDiagram" />

#### Notes

1. The search is case-insensitive, e.g. `find JOHN` will return both john and John.
2. The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `find Alice Tan` will match Tan Alice.
3. Only the applicant name is searched.
4. Any applicant whose name contains the sequence of characters given as the keyword will be given as a result. e.g. Ed
   will match both Edward and Ed.
   Applicants matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search).
   e.g. `find Ben Bobby` will return Ben Yang, Bobby Chin.

#### Steps to trigger

1. User opens the app.
2. User keys in `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`.
3. The GUI will update to show a list of applicants with name containing any of the keywords.

<puml src="diagrams/FindCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FindCommandActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: How to find applicants

- Alternative 1: Find applicants by name using exact match search
  (e.g. `find Eddy` will only result in applicants whose name is Eddy)
    - Pros: Users can find applicants by their exact name,
      allowing for a more specific search
    - Cons: Users would have to type in the entire name exactly in order to
      get their desired result. This can result in higher user error and takes more time to type.

- Alternative 2 (current choice): Find applicants by name using partial match search (or "fuzzy" search)
    - Pros: More inclusive, can find matches that are related but not exactly the same as `KEYWORD`.
      This is more user-friendly and allows for faster typing as users do not need to type the exact name out in order
      to find
      an applicant.

    - Cons: May return a larger number of results, some of which may not be relevant (false positives),
      potentially requiring additional filtering or sorting which can be inconvenient and time-consuming.

##### Aspect: Command syntax

- Alternative 1: `find n/NAME` where `n/` represents the name to be searched
    - Pros: Unambiguous that the term to be searched for is the name.
    - Cons: As the current find function only supports searching by name, adding the additional `n/` is unnecessary.

- Alternative 2 (current choice): `find KEYWORDS [MORE_KEYWORDS]`
    - Pros: Allows for faster typing as users do not need to input the unnecessary `n/` tag.
    - Cons: Not immediately clear that the `find` command finds applications by name.
      This will have to be explained in the user guide.

#### Future Extension:

A future extension to this find command is to allow it to find applicants by other fields such as their email or their
handphone number.
As handphone numbers and emails are likely to be distinct for each applicant, it is possible to
enhance the find feature so that it can also search for applicants by these fields.

<br>

<br>

### Import feature

#### Purpose

The `import` feature allows users to import data from a CSV file into Staff-Snap. This allows users to populate
Staff-Snap with data from other sources via the commonly used CSV format. By allowing users to import large amounts of
data from other sources without manually typing it in, Staff-Snap becomes more versatile and useful to users.

#### Implementation

The `import` feature is implemented as a command that takes in a CSV file name as an argument. The command is parsed by
the `ImportCommandParser` class, which then calls the `ImportCommand` class to execute the command. The `ImportCommand`
class uses the static `parse()` method under `CsvApplicantParser` to parse the applicant data into
a `List<CsvApplicant>` with the help of the `CsvToBeanBuilder<T>` class under `com.opencsv.bean` package. If
the `List<CsvApplicant>` has been successfully parsed, we then call the `ParserUtil::parseApplicantFromCsv()` method to
convert each `CsvApplicant` into `Applicant`. Lastly, we call the `ModelManager` class to import the data from
the `List<Applicant>` into Staff-Snap.

Below is the sequence diagram for the `import` feature:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ImportSequenceDiagram" />

#### Design Considerations

Before initiating the import process, we considered it crucial to perform a thorough validation of the CSV file. This
included checks for the file's existence, format, and integrity to ensure that the data can be successfully processed.

We also implemented a robust error-handling mechanism to gracefully manage scenarios where the CSV file is malformed or
contains errors. For example, to address the possibility of duplicate entries, we first check if the CSV contains
duplicate entries within itself, then we also check if the CSV contains entries which are duplicates with existing
entries in Staff-Snap. If such duplicates exists, we inform the user of the problematic entries and allow them to
rectify the entries before importing.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. The entire software should be able to be packaged into a single _JAR file_ for users to download.
3. The file size of the JAR file should not exceed 100MB.
4. A user who can type fast should be able to accomplish most tasks faster via a _command line interface (CLI)_,
   compared to a hypothetical GUI-only version of the app.
5. The product is for single-users. The application should not be running in a shared computer and with
   different people using it at different times.
6. The software should respond to user input within 5 seconds under normal load conditions.
7. There should be no shared file storage mechanism. The data file created by one user should not be accessed by
   another user during regular operations.
8. The data should be stored locally and should be in a _human editable text file_.
9. The software should work without requiring an installer.
10. The software should not depend on a remote server so that anyone can use the app at anytime.
11. The _GUI_ should not cause any resolution-related inconveniences to the user for
    standard screen resolutions 1920x1080 and higher, and for screen scales 100% and 125%.
12. All functions can be used via the GUI, even if the user experience is not optimal, for resolutions 1280x720 and
    higher,
    and for screen scales 150%.
13. The software should provide error messages which clearly states the error and provides guidance on correcting the
    error.
14. The software should provide easily accessible help in the form of documentation for users unfamiliar with the
    commands.
15. The software should include automated tests to ensure correctness and reliability.

       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Sorting applicants

1. Sorting applicants while all applicants are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all applicants using the `list` command. Multiple applicants in the list.

    2. Test case: `sort d/status`<br>
       Expected: The applicants in the list are sorted by their status, in the order UNDECIDED, OFFERED, REJECTED.
       Success message shown in the response area.
       Applicant area shows the updated list of applicants in the sorted order.

    3. Test case: `sort d/i`<br>
       Expected: The list of applicants is not sorted. Error details shown in the response area. Applicant list in
       applicant area remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect sort commands to try: `sort`, `sort d/`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Filtering applicants

1. Filtering applicants while all applicants are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all applicants using the `list` command. Multiple applicants in the list.

    2. Test case: `filter gts/5.0`<br>
       Expected: The applicants in the list are filtered by their score, and the updated list contains only applicants
       with score of at least 5.0.
       Success message shown in the response area. Applicant area shows the filtered list of applicants.

    3. Test case: `filter name`<br>
       Expected: The list of applicants is not filtered. Error details shown in the response area. Applicant list in
       applicant area remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect filter commands to try: `filter`, `filter n/`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Importing from CSV

1. Importing applicants from a CSV file

    1. Prerequisites: Download a sample CSV file [here](demo.csv). The correctly formatted CSV file `demo.csv` should be
       placed in the home folder of Staff-Snap (i.e. the same folder as the Staff-Snap JAR file).

    2. Test case: `import f/demo.csv`<br>
       Expected: The applicants are imported into Staff-Snap.
       Success message shown in the response area. Applicant area shows the updated list of applicants.

    3. Test case: `import f/.csv`<br>
       Expected: No applicants are not imported. Error details shown in the response area. Applicant list in applicant
       area remains the same.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Allow users to add applicants whose names include non-alphanumeric characters such as hyphens `-` and slashes `/`.
2. Provide an error message to the user if the selected CSV file for the `import` command does not contain the correct
   headers as specified.
3. Allow for filtering by email without providing a proper domain. This will be done by removing the type checking when
   entering an email into the `filter` command.
4. Provide an error message if `s/` in `filter` receives an invalid input, such as `p` or `2`.
5. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The temporary remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again. We plan to fix this issue in the next iteration.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Challenges Faced

Challenges were faced in evolving the AB3 codebase to support the new features. This was especially true when
implementing the Interview features. Since we evolved the Interview components out of the original Tag components, there
were many changes that had to be made in order to accommodate the functionalities we intended. For example, we wanted
the ability to cumulatively add interviews to an applicant, but the original AB3 Tag system would reset the entire Tag
list whenever it was edited.

We also faced challenges in implementing the `import` feature. This was because we had to learn how to use the OpenCSV
library and decide which functionalities to include. We also had to learn how to use the `CsvToBeanBuilder<T>` class
under the `com.opencsv.bean` package to parse the CSV file. While the use of OpenCSV helped to simplify the parsing
process, there were still many modification we made to enable the `import` feature. For example, we also had to create a
separate intermediate class `CsvApplicant` to store the data parsed from the CSV file before converting it into
an `Applicant` object.

### Effort Required

The team implemented proactive strategies such as establishing coding conventions, adopting branching strategies, and
breaking down
tasks into manageable units. Regular meetings were held to discuss the progress of the project
and regular communication channels were maintained for team members to update, seek assistance and share insights.

Regular testing and debugging sessions were conducted to identify and address any issues that arose during the
integration process. This was crucial to maintain a bug-free, reliable and stable application.

### Achievements

Despite all the challenges faced, we managed to overcome them as a team, picking up valuable skills along the way. We
are
proud of what we have achieved and are confident that Staff-Snap will be a useful tool for Hiring Managers to manage the
hiring and tracking of their applicants.
