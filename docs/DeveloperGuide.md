### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person and to commit the current state of the addressbook to be used for `undo` and `redo` commands).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered and sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The add feature is facilitated by the following operations:
* `AddCommandParser#parse` — Parses user's inputs and checks that inputs are valid.
* `model#hasPerson` — Checks if the employee exists in EmployeeManager.
* `model#addPerson` — Adds an employee to EmployeeManager.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `add i/A00001 n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com d/Finance r/Manager s/5000` to add a new employee `John Doe`.
The user input is parsed and checked using `AddCommandParser#parse` to create an `AddCommand` that contains the new employee.

Step 2: `AddCommand` then checks that the new employee is not a duplicate employee using `model#hasPerson` before
adding the new employee into EmployeeManager using `model#addPerson`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the add command:

<img src="images/AddActivityDiagram.png" width="425" />

#### Design considerations

Aspect: What is considered a duplicate employee:
* **Alternative 1:** Check if the name of the given employee matches the name of another employee in EmployeeManager.
  * Pros: Only need to check for duplicate names.
  * Cons: Employees can have the same names, so it is not realistic to restrict the addition of employees to only employees with different names.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Check if the ID of an employee matches the ID of another employee in EmployeeManager.
  * Pros: Able to store employees with the same attributes if their IDs are different.
  * Cons: Need to store an additional field for ID.

### History feature
The `history` feature allows users to access past valid commands that they made. This feature is supported by 
three classes, `CommandHistory`, `HistoryCommandParser` and `HistoryCommand`. 

#### Implementation

`CommandHistory`: This class is responsible for storing the history of valid commands that the user has entered.  
`HistoryCommandParser`: Parses the user input to create an appropriate HistoryCommand object.  
`HistoryCommand`: Executes the history command.  

After a successful user command has been executed `CommandHistory#add(input)` will be called to store the successful 
user input in the `CommandHistory`. When a user inputs a history command with the appropriate argument, the 
`AddressBookParser` will be called to produce the `HistoryCommandParser` to properly parse the input. A 
`HistoryCommand` object will be created. When the `Command#execute(model, commandHistory)` is called on the 
`HistoryCommand`, the `HistoryCommand` will call `CommandHistory#getUserCommandHistory()` to get the list of
valid user commands. `HistoryCommand` will then return a string of the appropriate number of user command that the
user has specified.

![History Command Class Diagram](images/HistoryCommandClassDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Which component should we choose to store CommandHistory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it under `Logic`.  
**Why:** The `Logic` component is responsible for command execution and parsing. 
Adding a history feature here would allow you to easily keep track of commands as they are executed.

* **Alternative 2:** Store it under `Model`.  
**Why:** The `Model` component is responsible for maintaining the state of the application. If we consider
the command history part of the application's state, it might make more sense to put it here.

**Decision:** Since the command history is only active for the duration of the application and does not need
to be saved, placing it in the `logic` component is more appropriate. If the command history need to persist
across sessions, it might be better to place it in the `model` component, as this layer is generally responsible
for data to be saved.

### Help feature
The `help` feature provides users with a summary of the commands and includes a link to the user guide for further reference.

#### Implementation
 
`HelpCommand`: Executes the help command.

When the user inputs a `help` command, the `AddressBookParser` will process the input and create a `HelpCommand`.
The `HelpCommand` is then executed by `Command#execute(model, commandHistory)` and produces a `CommandResult` that will display 
the help window to the user.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort command is facilitated by `ModelManager`. `ModelManager` contains a `SortedList<Person>` and 
`FilteredList<Person>` to provide sorting and filtering on the same list. The original list is fetched from 
`AddressBook#getPersonList()` and passed to the `FilteredList`. The `FilteredList` is then passed to the `SortedList`.
By returning the `SortedList` as an `ObservableList<Person>`, the UI will be able to update the person cards displayed
after the `find` or `sort` command has been used.

To facilitate comparing between two `Person` objects, the attributes also implement `Comparable<Person>`. The
comparators for the attributes can be used to then compare two Person on a specific attribute.

The command only allows for the sorting to be performed on one of the Person's attribute. The `SortCommandParser` will
extract the attribute, and create a `SortCommand` using the corresponding comparator for that attribute. The sequence 
diagram below illustrates how the comparator is obtained and passed to the Model to be executed.

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

  
### Find feature

#### Implementation

The Find feature is facilitated by the following operations:
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` — Updates the filtered person list based on the Predicate<Person> given to the FindCommand object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find n/alex bernice` to find all employees that either contain the full word `alex` or `bernice` in their name. 
`FindCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `FindCommand`.

Step 2. Then `FindCommand` is executed, and it will call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the filtered list in the model to only include
employees whose names contain either the full word `alex` or `bernice`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the find feature works:
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

</div>

### Edit feature
The `edit` feature allows users to update specific information about certain employees. This feature is supported by 
three classes, `EditCommand`, `EditCommandParser` and `Model`.

#### Implementation

`EditCommand`: Stores the edited changes to be changed.<br>
`EditCommandParser`: Parses the user's edit command to create an appropriate EditCommand object.<br>
`Model`: Fetches the employee list from `Model#getSortedFilteredPersonList()` and finds the employee whose information needs to be edited.

Given below is an example usage scenario of edit command. 

Step 1: The user enters `edit 2 p/12345678` to update the phone number of the second employee in the list. 
`EditCommandParser` parses the user command and creates a `EditCommand`.

Step 2: `EditCommand` then gets executed. It calls `Model#setPerson()` to update the information of the chosen employee.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the edit command works: 
![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Increment feature

#### Implementation

The increment feature is facilitated by the following operations:
* `Model#getSortedFilteredPersonList()` — Returns the list of employees in the filtered list.
* `Model#setPerson(target, editedPerson)` — Replaces the given `target` with the `editedPerson` that has the incremented salary with all other attributes of `target` unchanged.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the increment mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user has executed `find d/Marketing` to filter the employee list by the department `Marketing`.
* The `FindCommand` updates the filtered list in `Model` to contain only employees whose department is `Marketing`.

Step 2. The user executes `increment 1000` to increment the salaries of all employees in the filtered list.
The associated command `IncrementCommand` first calls `Model#getSortedFilteredPersonList()` to obtain the filtered list of persons.

Step 3. `IncrementCommand` then checks that the increment is valid for all persons in the filtered list using `IncrementCommand#checkValidIncrement(personList)`.

Step 4. For each person in the filtered list, an `editedPerson` with the incremented salary and no other details changed is constructed, before `Model#setPerson(target, editedPerson)` is called to replace the current person with the `editedPerson`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the increment feature works:
![IncrementSequenceDiagram](images/IncrementSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: When the validity of the given `increment` is checked:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check validity before incrementing any person’s salary.
  * Pros: Ensures that `increment` is valid before any modifications is made to the persons in EmployeeManager.
  * Cons: Have to loop through the filtered list twice: once to check the validity of `increment` and once to increment the salaries.

* **Alternative 2:** Check validity while incrementing each person’s salary.
  * Pros: Less time required to check and increment salaries.
  * Cons: If the `increment` is invalid for a person halfway through the list, some persons would have their salaries incremented while the remaining persons would not have their salaries incremented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history and remove undone states.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Clear feature

The `clear` feature is used to clear all persons from the displayed list in EmployeeManager.

#### Implementation
When the `clear` command is executed, it will call `Model#clearSortedFilteredPersonList`.
`Model#clearSortedFilteredPersonList` will loop through the persons in the filtered list and
delete each person from the filtered list using `Model#deletePerson` until the list is cleared.

![ClearCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


### Export/Import feature

The `export` feature allows the data file to be saved as a `.json` file on the disk. The `import` feature allows a
data file to be imported from the disk, replacing the current data in the application.

#### Implementation

The import and export commands both use `JsonAddressBookStorage` to facilitate writing and reading of data files.

The import command calls `JsonAddressBookStorage#readAddressBook` which will read the file in the specified file path
and attempt to parse the JSON data into a `ReadOnlyAddressBook`. The function also checks if the data file is invalid,
such as if it contains illegal value, or if no file is found at the file path.

The export command calls `JsonAddressBookStorage#saveAddressBook` which will serialize a `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and
write it to the file path on the disk.

A GUI option for importing and exporting was also implemented to allow users who are unfamiliar with file paths to use
the feature as well.

Another implementation detail is creating an abstract class `FileCommand` which inherits `Command`. Both `ImportCommand`
and `ExportCommand` inherit `FileCommand`. The reason for creating the `FileCommand` class is to reduce code 
duplication as both commands share the same logic for checking the validity of the `Path` received.

![FileCommandClassDiagram](images/FileCommandClassDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Format of the export & import command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `export FILE_PATH`, `import FILE_PATH`.
    * Pros: Provides flexibility in where the file can be exported to and imported from.
    * Cons: Not all users might be familiar with specifying file paths. However, it can be mitigated
      with a GUI option to select the file path.

* **Alternative 2:** `export FILE_NAME`, `import FILE_NAME`.
    * Pros: Simple to use, only have to specify file name and not be concerned with file path.
    * Cons: Troublesome, the files must be exported and imported from the same directory as the application.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### 1. Export command FILE_NAME should be a non-empty String

The current implementation of `export` command allows the use of an empty string as the FILE_NAME, allowing commands like `export .json` to be executed.
This behaviour, while functional on Windows, results in the creation of hidden files in other operating systems, leading to inconsistent behavior. 
To address this, we plan to make the validation checks stricter for the 
FILE_NAME in the `export` command. This enhancement will prevent the use of empty strings in FILE_NAME, 
thereby reducing the chances of bugs and ensuring a more consistent experience across different operating systems.

### 2. Allow the use of prefixes in name field

The current implementation of EmployeeManager triggers errors when prefixes are used in names.
For example, `s/` is designated as a prefix for salary. As a result, when the name field includes `s/o`, it triggers 
several errors such as those related to multiple prefixes or salary constraints. 

![PlannedEnhancementSOError](images/PlannedEnhancementSOError.png)

We plan to add an escape character, such as a backslash, "\\", This will allow more flexibility for name entries. For example, with this enhancement, a command like `edit 1 n/John \s/o dep` would be valid,
changing the name of the person at index one to `John s/o dep`. The `s/o` will be recognised as part of a name rather than a salary prefix.

### 3. Change all mentions of addressbook to employeemanager

Our project is a brownfield project adapted from AB3, it contains several references to addressbook such as the `AddressBookParser` and `AddressBook`. 
While our primary focus has been on enhancing and improving the functionality of the software to cater to our target audience, we recognise the 
need to have consistent naming conventions for clarity. Therefore, we plan to update all mentions of `addressbook` to `employeemanager`.

### 4. Stringent email validation

The current implementation of EmployeeManager allows invalid emails such as `abc@gmail`, which fall short of the standard email address formats. 
We understand the importance of data validation to our target audience, hence we plan add more stringent email validation that checks for proper
`username@domainname.extension` formatting.

### 5. Improve clarity of success message for `undo` commands

The current implementation of the `undo` command only shows that the command has been undone successfully, it does not specify what command has been undone. 

![PlannedEnhancementUndoSuccessMessage](images/PlannedEnhancementUndoSuccessMessage.png)

To enhance user experience and provide detailed feedback to the user, we plan to include the specific command that was undone.

### 6. Improve clarity of success message for `redo` commands

The current implementation of the `redo` command only shows that the command has been redone successfully, it does not specify what command has been redone.

To enhance user experience and provide detailed feedback to the user, we plan to include the specific command that was redone.

### 7. Enhance validation for `sort` command

The current implementation of the `sort` command allows users to input additional values after the sorting prefix, although they will be ignored. 
For example commands like `sort n/abc` and `sort n/s/` are both valid sort commands that will sort by name. 
We plan to enhance validation such that an error message will be shown if extra values are input after the sorting prefix.
The proposed error message, `The sort command prefixes should not be used with values`, will guide the user towards the correct usage of the `sort` command.

### 8. Enhance error message for `edit` command

The current implementation of EmployeeManager checks for duplicate employees based on their `Id` field.
Consequently, editing an employee's `Id` to a value that already exists will result in an error message `This person already exists in the address book.`.
This might be unclear to the users as the error message is not specific in stating what causes the duplicate.
We plan to enhance the error message to make it clearer. For example, by stating that 
`This employee id is already in use and may result in a duplicate person.`.

### 9. Increase support for a broader range of display compatibility

The current implementation of EmployeeManager is optimized for standard screen resolutions, specifically 1920x1080, and is best viewed at a screen scale of 100%.
We plan to enhance EmployeeManager's display compatibility with a broader range of screen resolutions and scales, to suit all office needs.

### 10. Allow `sort` to be case-insensitive 

The current implementation of the `sort` command sorts the person list by their attribute in lexicographical order. However, this can lead to unintended behaviour as it is case-sensitive. For example, if there are three persons with departments: `Finance`, `IT`, `finance`, the persons from the finance department would be separated by `IT` due to lexicographical order. We intend to make `sort` command case-insensitive by default, and allow case-sensitive by specifying an addition flag.

The original command looks like: `sort d/`, and our new proposed format might look like `sort d/ case/` with the `case/` flag specifying the sort should be case-sensitive, and lack of flag specifying the sort should be case-insensitive.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty level
We felt that the difficulty level was moderate. The original AB3 codebase was large and it took us some time to understand how the components worked together. 

### Challenges encountered
This list highlights some of the key challenges we faced:
1. It was challenging to change the person class at the start of our project as we needed to coordinate extensively with one another to avoid high amounts of merge conflicts.
1. As our salary attribute needed to hold a number and conduct operations on it, there were problems arising from the usage of floating point numbers. We had to change from using `double` to using `long` to fix those bugs.
1. The implementation of the `sort` command was not straightforward. JavaFX API only has `SortedList` and `FilteredList`. To achieve both effects, we had to find a way to ‘combine’ them to allow sorting and filtering on the same list.
1. For the `import` and `export` commands, the file path was difficult to handle. Different operating systems have different formats and specifications. The tests had to be designed for the different OS as well.
1. For the `history` command, we had to decide where to store the class that was supposed to store the previous command and how it should be integrated into the application.
1. For the `find` command, we had to find a way to combine all the predicates into one so that we can find employees who fulfill multiple find parameters. There was also a challenge faced with finding employees by salary which is related to the aforementioned challenge with salary.
1. We had to create and go through multiple mockups for the UI to decide which design was best suited for the product.

### Effort required
1. Modified code base heavily.
1. Weekly meetings to discuss progress and plan weekly tasks.
1. We created a comprehensive suite of tests to cover a wide range of cases.

### Achievements
1. Successfully met all milestones and deadlines.
1. Implemented most of our important user stories.
1. Practiced good software engineering practices.
   1. Forking Workflow
   1. Issues Tracker, Milestones, etc.
   1. Code Quality
