## **Design**

### Architecture
<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above illustrates the high-level design of the App. 

You can see that the bulk of the app's works are done by the UI, Logic, Model and Storage components. Below are the general duties of each component and how they interact with each other.

#### Duties of each component
[**`UI`**](#ui-component) is responsible for
* Rendering visuals to the user.
* Handling and responding to user interactions.

[**`Logic`**](#logic-component) is responsible for 
* Interpreting the user command to find the corresponding strategies to execute.
* Parsing the user command to construct the corresponding parameters for the strategies.
* Executing the strategies to modify the data and state of the app.
* Updating the UI to reflect the changes in the data and state of the app.

[**`Model`**](#model-component) is responsible for
* Providing accurate representation of the current data and state of the app
* Providing APIs for other components to access and modify the data and state.

[**`Storage`**](#storage-component): is responsible for
* Loading the user data from the hard disk.
* Saving the user data to the hard disk.

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

[**`UI`**](#ui-component):
* Delegates the interpretation of user command to the `Logic` component. 
* Relies on the `Model` component to obtain the appropriate data to display.

[**`Logic`**](#logic-component):
* Informs `UI` what to display.
* Utilises `Model` to access and modify the current data and state <br>
* Instructs `Storage` to save data to the hard disk.

[**`Model`**](#model-component): 
* Provides APIs for `Logic` and `UI` to access and modify the data. 
* Depends on `Storage` to load data from the hard disk to initialise.

[**`Storage`**](#storage-component):
* Provides APIs for `Logic` to save data to the hard disk.
* Provides APIs for `Model` to load data from the hard disk to initialise.

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />
</p>

#### Other notes

1. Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above)
   * Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
   * Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point. 
   
   For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.
2. The team has decided to force all components to interact via interfaces rather than the concrete classes as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component).
<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />
</p>

If you are to contribute to this project, please align with this group decision.

3. There are other components that are not shown in the diagram above. These components are: 
    * `Commons` component: contains classes that are used by multiple other components.
    * `Entry Point` classes: `Main` and `MainApp` classes that are in charge of the app launch and shut down.
4. Please be reminded that, despite similar naming, our architecture is not the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architecture. The major difference is that there is not a clear "Controller" component in our architecture. Instead, the role of the "Controller" is played by all the main components (UI, Logic, Model and Storage) working together.

The sections below give more details of each component.

## Components

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* consists of 2 sides: the left side being the lists section and the right side being the details section.
* depends on the `State` of the app currently to show the appropriate list panels.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

At a high level, the `Logic` component is responsible for making sense of the user inputs, and modifying storage and ui accordingly.
It acts like a controller to glue the other components together.

It interacts with the `UI` component by taking the user input from it, and setting the UI display accordingly.
It also calls APIs (addPerson, deleteLesson for example) from the `Model` component to modify the data representation, and call APIs
from the `Storage` component to save the data to local storage each time the data is modified.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.
<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />
</p>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

Inside the `Logic` component, there are 4 main components: `LogicManager`, `AddressBookParser`, `Parser` classes and `Command` classes.

The `Command` class will do the actual modification of the data, when executed by the `LogicManager`, and communicate its execution result via the `CommandResult` class with the `LogicManager`. 

Parser classes are responsible for parsing the user input and creating the corresponding command object. 

`AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input for finding the corresponding parser and returning the corresponding command object. 

`LogicManager` will perform the actual execution of the command, and update the user interface and data storage.

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:
<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>
</p>



How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:
<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="400"/>
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" />
</p>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the schedule data i.e., all `lesson` objects (which are contained in a `Schedule` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the task data of all the lessons i.e., all `task` objects (which are contained in the `TaskList` objects of each `Lesson` object).
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
* links to the UI component to display the Show Details Panel in the UI (to reduce code complexity).
* stores a `State` object that represents the current state of the app. Currently, there are 3 main states: `STUDENT`, `SCHEDULE` and `TASK` state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</p>

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />
</p>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, user preference data, and schedule data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `ScheduleStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Entry point classes
**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

### Common classes

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. They are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### App State 

#### Background

TutorMate has 3 main "modes" each to cater to the main features. We refer to them as "states", where we implement it using the `State` enum.
The different states have their own set of UI layout and commands, while some commands work for all states but has different behaviours between them.
The 3 main states are `STUDENT`, `SCHEDULE` and `TASK`.
* `STUDENT` state handles the student management system feature.
* `SCHEDULE` state handles lessons and schedules.
* `TASK` state handles tasks for lessons.

#### Implementation

The `ModelManager` class stores the current state of the app. The default state is `SCHEDULE`. It implements the following operations for the show command:

The `ModelManager#getState()` returns the current state of the app, `ModelManager#setState()` sets the app's state, and `ModelManager#sameState()` checks if the given state is the same as the app's state.


##### 1. Parser Overloading

States allows the same command word to be mapped to different commands based on the current app state. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` handles the parsing of user input into its respective parsers and commands.

For example, the "add" command word is overloaded, where using the `ModelManager#sameState()` method:
* If it's in `STUDENT` state, it returns the `AddPersonCommandParser`, which returns the `AddPersonCommand` command class.
* If it's in `SCHEDULE` state, it returns the `AddLessonCommandParser`, which returns the `AddLessonCommand` command class.

##### 2. Command Overloading

States allows the same command to have differing behaviours based on the current app state.
Commands can easily enable this by modifying its `execute` method and implement a switch statement that executes different functions based on the model state.

For example, the "find" command is overloaded, where using the `ModelManager#sameState()` method:
* If it's in `STUDENT` state, it searches through the list of students.
* If it's in `SCHEDULE` state, it searches through the list of lessons.

##### 3. UI updates

When commands change the app state (i.e. model state), using the `ModelManager#setState()` method, it will automatically call the `UiManager` class to make necessary UI changes.
The `UiManager` class calls the `MainWindow#changeLayout()` method to make necessary changes to the layout based on the new state:
* If the new state is `STUDENT` state, only show the `PersonList` (list for students) and `studentDetailList`.
* If the new state is `SCHEDULE` state, only show the `ScheduleList` and `lessonDetailList`.
* If the new state is `TASK` state, only show the `fullTaskList` and `taskDetailListPanel`.

#### Example execution
Given below is an example usage scenario of the `addPerson` command changes the model state and UI layout.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The initial state of the Model will be set to `SCHEDULE`. The schedule list will be initialized with the initial schedule.

Step 2. User enters the command `addPerson -name Alice`. The `execute` method of the `AddPersonCommand` will be called by the logicManager. The `execute` command will call the `addPerson` method in the `ModelManager` class to add a new person to the app.

Step 3. `AddPersonCommand` will change the app state to `STUDENT` by calling the `ModelManager#setState()` method, which changes the model state to `STUDENT`.

Step 4. Since the current model state is `SCHEDULE`, the `ModelManager#setState()` method will call the `UiManager#changeLayout()` method, which calls the `MainWindow#changeLayout()` method.

Step 5. The `MainWindow#changeLayout()` method will hide all panels and only show the `PersonList` (list for students) and `studentDetailList`.

Step 6. `AddPersonCommand` will then call the `ModelManager#showPerson()` method, which will display the newly added person's details (not shown in diagram, described in next section).

The following sequence diagram shows how the flow of the example execution:

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram" />
</p>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddPersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to structure app to work with the 3 main modes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement app state, where commands can check and modify the current app state.
    * Pros: 
      * Commands can be overloaded since they can have different behaviours based on app state, reducing number of commands for user to remember.
      * Commands do not need to handle changing of UI layouts (specifying panels it requires), since similar features (e.g. managing students) all require the same panels. The `UiManager` will make required UI changes based on desired state.
    * Cons: Increase complexity of the code.

* **Alternative 2:** Have a collection of related commands that are grouped to work with each main mode.
    * Pros: Easy to implement
    * Cons: 
      * Many commands for user to remember, although they have similar ideas (e.g. `addPerson`, `addLesson` both involving adding a new object, which the user could have used a generic `add` method.)
      * Commands have to manually call the UI to specify which UI panels to show.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### EditPersonCommand and Parser

#### Background
To boost usability and support more functionalities, many commands in TutorMate support multiple forms of valid user input.

For example, when editing a person, the `INDEX` parameter can be conditionally omitted when editing the currently shown entry, the `edit` command word is overloaded for both `editLesson` and `editPerson` command, and for each of these two commands, many optional flags are available.

Given this flexibility and variety of valid user input, it is a challenge to parse all form of valid user input correctly and efficiently. 

The implementation of the `EditPersonCommand` and `EditPersonCommandParser` can serve as a good example to represent how we tackle this challenge at command and parser class level to achieve the desired flexibility and usability while keeping the code clean and maintainable.

#### Implementation
The parsing and execution process of the `EditPersonCommand` is achieved via the combination of four groups of classes: `AddressBookParser`, `TypeParsingUtil`, `EditPersonCommandParser` and `EditPersonCommand`, each of which is responsible for a different stage of the parsing process. 

Given a user input that is intended to be parsed into an `EditPersonCommand`, a high level description of the parsing process is as follows:

The first stage is to understand that user intends to invoke the `EditPersonCommand` and delegate the parsing to the specialised parser class, `EditPersonCommmandParser`. This step is done by the `AddressBookParser` class, which behaves like a "simple factory" via a giant "switch" statement. We will not discuss it in depth here.

The second stage is to parse each parameter and flags. This work is delegated to the `TypeParsingUtil` class, which is a utility class that contains many static methods that are responsible for parsing different types of user input that is reused across different command parsers.

Then, the `EditPersonCommandParser` class is responsible for combining the results of the previous stage and constructing the `EditPersonCommand` object.

Finally, the `EditPersonCommand` class is responsible for executing the command and updating the model accordingly.

The following section will discuss the implementation of the later three groups of classes in more detail.

##### 1. ListEntry and ListEntryField class
In TutorMate, Lesson and Person extends `ListEntry` class as they are displayed as items of the ___STUDENTS list___, ___SCHEDULE list___ respectively.

Each `ListEntry` object contains a list of `ListEntryField` objects, which are the fields of the `ListEntry` object. For example, a `Person` object contains a list of `ListEntryField` objects, which are the fields of the `Person` object, such as name, phone number, email address, etc.

These two classes are used in multiple generic classes and methods to achieve the flexibility and robustness of the parsing process.

##### 2. Parsing of Flags and Parameters
The `TypeParsingUtil` class parses all kinds of flags (which are all `ListEntryField` ) via a single powerful generic method, `parseField`. The method signature is as follows:
```
 public static <T extends ListEntryField> T parseField(String flagName,
                                                          String input,
                                                          Of<T> of,
                                                          boolean isOptional) throws ParseException
```
The first parameter, `flagName`, is the name of the flag that is being parsed. It will also be used to generate the error message when the parsing fails.

The second parameter, `input`, is the user input that is intended to be parsed into the flag.

The third parameter, `of`, is a self-defined functional interface that is to be used as the "factory" to create the flag object. The `of` method signature is as follows:
```
public interface Of<T extends ListEntryField> {
    T apply(String str) throws IllegalArgumentException, ParseException;
}
```
The last parameter, `isOptional`, is a boolean flag that indicates whether the flag is optional or not. If the flag is not found in the user input, this method will throw a `ParseException` if the flag is not optional, but will return a `null` object if the flag is optional. It is overloaded to have a default value of `true` when omitted.


The `parseField` method is reused extensively in multiple parser classes to parse all the flags. The following is an example of how it can be used:
```
// Parse the name flag, which is compulsory
Name name = TypeParsingUtil.parseField("name", args, Name::of, false);

// Parse the phone flag, which is optional
Phone phone = TypeParsingUtil.parseField("phone", args, Phone::of);
```
##### 3. Parsing of the EditPersonCommand
The `EditPersonCommandParser` class will parse the user input into an `EditPersonCommand` object. 

This is achieved by combining the results of parsing flags in the previous stage and construct a `Person` object that contains the updated fields.

Each of the `ListEntryField` has a global and static singleton default instance. For example, the default `Phone` is a `Phone` object with message "To be added". Please also note that it is not possible to create a `Phone` object with such message via public constructor and factory method.

Each of the `ListEntry` also has a global and static singleton default instance whose fields are all the default `ListEntryField` objects. We can obtain a clone of the default `ListEntry` object via a static method in the class method.

The `EditPersonCommandParser` class will first obtain a clone of the default `Person` object via the `getDefault` method, and then update the fields of the `Person` object with the results of parsing flags in the previous stage when the corresponding flags are found in the user input.

The following is an example of how it can be used:
```
Person person = Person.getDefaultPerson();
            person.setNameIfNotDefault(parseField("name", args, Name::of, nameIsOptional));
            person.setPhoneIfNotDefault(parseField("phone", args, Phone::of));
            person.setEmailIfNotDefault(parseField("email", args, Email::of));
            person.setAddressIfNotDefault(parseField("address", args, Address::of));
            person.setSubjectsIfNotDefault(parseField("subject", args, Subjects::of));
            person.setTagsIfNotDefault(parseField("tag", args, Tags::of));
            person.setRemarkIfNotDefault(parseField("remark", args, Remark::of));
```
##### 4. EditPersonCommand Implementation
The `EditPersonCommand` class will execute the command and update the model accordingly.

Realising the commonality between all kinds of edit commands, we have created an abstract generic class, `AbstractEditCommand`, to serve as template class containing the logic of editing a `ListEntry` object.

The signature of the `AbstractEditCommand` class is as follows:
```
public abstract class AbstractEditCommand<T extends ListEntry<? extends T>> extends Command
```
And the concrete edit classes (`EditPersonCommand` class for example) can be simply implemented by "filling in the blank" and providing the correct parameters to the template class.

The template for the edit process is as follows:
```
initModelMethods();
init();
editFields();
updatePersonLessonMap();
validateEditedAndWriteBack();
showMethod.accept(edited);
return new CommandResult("Edit success.\n from: " + original.toString() + "\n to: " + edited.toString());
```
The `EditPersonCommand` class can be simply implemented by overriding the abstract methods in the `AbstractEditCommand` class.

The most important method to be overridden is the initModelMethods(), which looks like this in the `EditPersonCommand` class:
```
 @Override
    protected void initModelMethods() {
        currentShownEntry = model.getCurrentlyDisplayedPerson();
        list = model.getFilteredPersonList();
        hasClashWith = model::hasPersonClashWith;
        deleteMethod = model::deletePersonForEdit;
        addMethod = model::addPerson;
        getClashingEntry = model::getPersonClashWith;
        showMethod = model::showPerson;
    }
```

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to keep the code clean and maintainable while providing the flexibility and variety of valid user input.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Group the parsing and execution of a command into four groups of classes: `AddressBookParser`, `TypeParsingUtil`, `EditPersonCommandParser` and `EditPersonCommand`.
    * Pros:
        * Clear separation of concerns.
        * Easy to maintain, easy to extend as for each new `ListEntryField` and `ListEntry` class that is added and fulfill the contract of the `ListEntryField` and `ListEntry` class, the parsing and execution of the command will almost be automatically supported.
        * Good DRY principle. Only one method is needed to parse all kinds of flags, the knowledge of a given type of processing is encapsulated in a single place.
    * Cons: Less flexible. It is not easy to add flags that have special parsing logic not supported by the current template.

* **Alternative 2:** Having even stricter constraints on the `ListEntryField` and `ListEntry` class, so that we can use reflection feature of Java to automatically parse the flags.
    * Pros: Potentially better extensibility.
    * Cons:
        * Difficult to implement.
        * Even more difficult to debug.
        * Even less flexible.
        * Not easy to get the correct error message and type, as if the call via reflection throws exception, `ParseException` for example, the reflection call will always overwrite the original exception and throw an `InvocationTargetException` instead.
* **Alternative 3:** Writing a separate parser class for each command.
    * Pros: Flexible. Easy to implement.
    * Cons: 
        * Many redundant code.
        * Difficult to maintain as the code is not DRY.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Show feature

#### Implementation

The show feature is facilitated by `ShowCommand` which extends the abstract `Command` class. The `ShowCommand` will check the current state of the Model (either `STUDENT`, `SCHEDULE`, `TASK` or `NONE`) when the `execute` method is called and see whether it is currently showing a ___STUDENTS list___, ___SCHEDULE list___ or a ___TASKS list___. 

Additionally, the `ModelManager` class implements the following operations for the show command:

`ModelManager#linkUi()` — Links the UI of TutorMate to the Model to display the Show Panel
`ModelManager#showPerson()` — Shows the details of the specified person in the UI.
`ModelManager#showLesson()` — Shows the details of the specified lesson in the UI.
`ModelManager#showTask()` — Shows the details of the specified task in the UI.

The Show Command has different behaviours based on the current state in the `Model`:
- The Show Command will show the Person Details if the current state is `STUDENT`
- The Show Command will show the Lesson Details if the current state is `SCHEDULE`
- The Show Command will show the Task Details if the current state is `TASK` 

The `execute` method of `ShowCommand` will be called by the logicManager when the `show` command is input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The initial state of the Model will be set to `SCHEDULE`. The schedule list will be initialized with the initial schedule.

Step 2. The user executes `show 5` command to show the details of the 5th lesson in the schedule list. The `execute` method of the `ShowCommand` will be called by the logicManager. The `execute` command will call the `showLesson` method in the ModelManager which displays the `LessonDetailListPanel` in the UI.

Step 3. The user wants to display the details of a person and switches to the student list with the `list students` command in the Command Line Interface(CLI) UI. The current list will display the students and the Model state will change to `STUDENT`.

Step 4. The user executes `show 1` command to show the details of the 1st person in the student list. The `execute` method of the `ShowCommand` will be called by the logicManager. The `execute` command will call the `showPerson` method in the ModelManager which displays the `StudentDetailListPanel` in the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the show operation works for showing a person from the `STUDENT` list:

</p>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ShowCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the Show Command calls the UI to display the Show Details Panel:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Link the Model with the UI to display the Show Details Panel.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May increase coupling between the Model and UI

* **Alternative 2:** Pass the UI call from the Show Command around the currently linked files.
    * Pros: No additional coupling created.
    * Cons: Many files will have to be changed and will increase the complexity of the code.

### Task List Feature

#### Implementation

The task list functionality is facilitated by multiple related classes. The `TaskList` can contain any number of `Task` objects. The `TaskList` is implemented as a component of each Lesson so that each lesson will have its own individual Task List.

The `FullTaskList` class is implemented as a list to view all the collective tasks of all the lessons. It uses a similar structure to `ScheduleList` to display the list.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the Task List structure should be implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each individual Lesson will contain a Task List.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May be hard to increase navigability from students to lessons and tasks.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a central Task List and filter the tasks for each lesson.
    * Pros: May be easier to increase navigability.
    * Cons: May increase code complexity due to filtering the respective tasks.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Linking Lessons to Students

#### Implementation

The Link feature is facilitated by the `LinkCommand` class, as well as the `BiDirectionalMap` class. As its name suggests, the `BiDirectionalMap` is a class that contains two maps, a "Forward" map and a "Reverse" map. The "Forward" map maps keys to values, and the "Reverse" map maps the values back to the keys.

This allows us to hold both a mapping of `Person` to `Lesson` and `Lesson` to `Person` at the same time.
The `BiDirectionalMap` class exposes a few useful methods such as `addMapping`, `removeMapping`, `get` and `getReversed` that help to manipulate both maps at once.

The Link Command supports two different commands depending on the current State:
- In either state, the command `link` allows linking of any specified student to any specified lesson
- When in the ___STUDENTS list___ and a student is selected via `show INDEX`, the `linkTo` command allows linking of the selected student to any specified lesson
- When in the ___SCHEDULE list___ and a lesson is selected via `show INDEX`, the `linkTo` command allows linking of the selected lesson to any specified student

When a user successfully runs either one of these commands, the app gets the relevant `Person` and the relevant `Lesson` from the `ModelManager` through a simple search using the names of each.
A check to ensure the entered student and lesson exists and that they are not already linked is carried out.

Then, `BiDirectionalMap#addMapping()` is called to create a map between the student and lesson. 

<p style="text-align: center;">
<puml src="diagrams/LinkSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="LinkSequenceDiagram" />
</p>

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How the mapping of students to lessons should be handled**
* **Alternative 1:**: Store the lessons that a student has in the `Person` class as an `ArrayList<Lesson>`
  * Pros
    * Easy to implement
  * Cons
    * Hard to implement reverse navigation (from lesson to student).<br/>
    * Hard to prevent stale data. Suppose a lesson name is updated, which means the app will have to traverse each student's lessons and make sure to update the correct lesson. There needs to be sufficient conflict checking too. This increases code complexity.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Use a bidirectional map that links a student to lessons while also linking a lesson to a student
  * Pros
    * Allows for bidirectional navigation and easy updating
  * Cons
    * Requires more code to implement the updating of both maps. 
    * Serializing and deserializing requires a longer method to parse and generate both maps.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
### Deleting of tags
- **Relevant feature:** editing of students `editPerson`
- **Current issues:** Once a tag is added to a student, the `editPerson` command prevents you from deleting the tag. This is because by specifying the flag `-tag`, the parameter provided as the tag must be a non-empty string.
- **Proposed new behaviour:** The `-tag` flag can be made to accept an empty string. 
  - Input: `editPerson 1 -tag`
  - Expected output: The person at index 1 should have no more tags set.

### Unlinking of students from lessons and vice versa
- **Relevant feature:** linking `linkTo`, `link`
- **Current issues:** Once a student has been linked to a lesson, there is no way to unlink them.
- **Proposed new behaviour:** A new `unlinkFrom` and `unlink` command that mirrors `linkTo` and `link`, which will unlink the specified lesson and student if it detects that they have already been linked.
  - Input: `linkTo Bernice Yu`
  - Expected output: Bernice Yu is linked to the current lesson
  - Input: `unlinkFrom Bernice Yu`
  - Expected output: Bernice Yu is unlinked from the current lesson.

### Navigating from tasks to lesson
- **Relevant feature:** Task Lists `list tasks`
- **Current issues:** There's no way to see what lesson a task is under.
- **Proposed new behaviour:** The `nav` command should also work when viewing a task.
  - Input: `nav`
  - Expected output: The screen changes to the lesson that the task is assigned to.
