### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_person 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_person 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_person 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePersonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`(which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Event` objects (which are contained in a `EventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `Logger` object that is used to log messages of the application's behaviour.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Flow of Program Execution**

The way the user interacts with the program is illustrated as follows.

![FlowOfProgram](images/CommandFlowActivityDiagram.png)

The following is a (partial) explanation of the flow of events:
1. The user makes their command by issuing a command in the CommandBox.
2. The command is parsed by the Parser and the corresponding Command object is created.
3. The Command object is executed.
4. The Command is executed and returns a CommandResult.
5. The CommandResult is passed to the UI component to be displayed to the user.

More details are captured in the diagram above.

If the command involves the changing of Models, the Models are updated accordingly at stage 3 during the execution process.
Changes to the models will also be reflected in Storage in the backend.
These model changes will also be reflected in the Ui (e.g when a Person or an Event is changed).

The errors during process and execution are also handled accordingly by displaying an error message to the user.

The object diagram below illustrates a possible state of the Models after some commands have been executed.

![Model state](images/AddEventObjectDiagram.png)

Assume that the user just added a `Meeting` which is a subtype of `Event`. They supplied the meeting with a name, a start date and a start time. The user also added some previous events and persons as shown in the diagram.

This shows how the Models are stored for use in the program.

Note that even though EventList stores a list of Events, currently only Meetings (a subtype of Event) are implemented. This is to allow for future extensibility of the program.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

### Commands
This section explains the general implementation of all commands.

The following activity diagrams shows the overall flow of events that the user will experience.

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

#### Parser Commands
This section explains the implementation and execution of commands that have their own specific parser.

Below is the sequence diagram for the execution of these commands (denoted by `XYZCommand`) after user input is sent to `LogicManager`. The execution of each of the command has been omitted due to their inherent differences and will be covered in their respective command sections below.

![Command Parser Sequence Diagram](images/CommandsParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The user enters a command with the necessary parameters which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2:
The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` for it to identify the type of command.

Step 3:
The `AddressBookParser` parses the user input and creates a command parser for that specific command. (denoted by `XYZCommandParser`)

Step 4:
The command parser is returned to the `AddressBookParser` which then calls `XYZCommandParser::parse` to parse the additional parameters.

Step 5:
The `XYZCommandParser` creates its respective command object (denoted by `XYZCommand`) and returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6:
The `LogicManager` calls `XYZCommand::execute` where the interaction between the command and the model is handled.

Step 7:
The `XYZCommand` creates a successful `CommandResult` and returns it to the UI.

### Ability to add persons
This section explains the implementation of the Add Task feature via the `add_person` command.
The `AddPersonCommand` causes the specified `Person` to be added to the Persons List in the application.
There is only one compulsory field which is the name of the Person. There are several optional fields such as the phone number, email address, address, birthday and remark of the Person.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `AddTaskCommand`.

#### Implementation details

The `add_person` feature involves creating a new `Person` object with optional fields and adding it to FumbleLog. 

This is done using `AddPersonCommand` which implements the `Command` interface. The `AddPersonCommand` is then executed by `LogicManager` which calls `ModelManager` to add the person to the address book.

As a result, the existing `Person` class in AB3's implementation is enhanced to have the capacity of storing optional fields.
Below is a class diagram of the enhanced 'Person' class:

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" alt="PersonClassDiagram" width=500 />

The `Person` object is now composed of the following optional attributes due to the refactored `add` feature:

* `Name`: The name of the person. Compulsory field.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the person. Optional field.
* `Email`: The email address of the person. Optional field.
* `Address`: The address of the person. Optional field.
* `Birthday`: The birthday of the person. Optional field.
* `Remark`: The remark of the person. Optional field.
* `Group`: The groups that the person is associated with. Optional field.

The [**`java.util.Optional<T>`**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) class is used to represent the optional attributes of the `Person` object.

To add a person, the user must specify the name of the person using the `n/` prefix. The user can then specify the optional attributes of the person using the following prefixes:

<box type="info">

Except for the `Name`, all the fields given to the `add_person` command are optional.

</box>

The flow for the `add_person` command is described by the following sequence diagram:

<img src="images/AddPersonSequenceDiagram2.png" alt="AddPersonSequenceDiagram2" width=600 />

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `AddPersonCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::addPerson`.

Step 2:
The `Model` will invoke `addPerson` in `AddressBook`, which in turn calls `add` in `UniquePersonList` to add the person to the list.

Step 3:
The `AddPersonCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.

#### Feature details
1. The application will validate the arguments supplied by the user; whether the `Name` is unique and supplied, and whether the optional fields follow the correct format. 
2. If the arguments are invalid, an error message will be shown to the user and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If the arguments are valid, a `Person` object will be created with the fields supplied and stored in FumbleLog.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Generic Design**

The original implementation of AB3's `Person` class is refactored to have the capacity of storing optional fields. This is done by using the `java.util.Optional<T>` class to represent the optional attributes of the `Person` object.
Furthermore, we have added additional fields into the `Person` class to allow users to store more information about the person, such as their birthday.

As the original `add` command already exists in AB3, this feature can be implemented by enhancing the `add` command. In FumbleLog, the `add` command is further changed to `add_person`.

Furthermore, we accounted for empty/null inputs in the optional fields by generating a NULL_INSTANCE for the optional fields when the user does not specify the optional fields. This design decision allowed us to easily check
for empty/null inputs in the Person object by checking if the optional field is not equal to the NULL_INSTANCE, instead of doing null pointer and empty string checks.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Enhance the existing `add_person` command.
  * Pros: 
    * Easier to implement.
    * Reuses the logic for the `add_person` command.
  * Cons:
    * Have to account for empty/null inputs in the optional fields when saving the data and testing it
    * Have to account for empty/null inputs in the optional fields when displaying the data
* **Alternative 2**: Create a new `add_person_optional` command.
  * Pros: 
    * Do not have to account for empty/null inputs in the optional fields when saving the data and testing it
  * Cons:
    * Inconveniences the user as they have to remember a new command to add a person with optional fields.

### Ability to delete persons

This section explains the implementation of the Delete Person feature via the `delete_person` command. The `DeletePersonCommand` causes the specified `Person` identified using the `Index` to be deleted from the UniquePerson List in the application. There is one compulsory field which is the Index of the Person to delete.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `DeletePersonCommand`.

![DeletePersonCommand Sequence Diagram](images/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `DeletePersonCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::deletePerson`.

Step 2:
The `Model` will invoke `removePerson` in `AddressBook`, which in turn calls `remove` in `UniquePersonList` to remove it from the list.

Step 3:
The `DeletePersonCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How we execute the DeletePersonCommand:**
Similar to the `AddPersonCommand`, the main considerations for this command is related to the way that the model is stored.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Ability to track events

This subsection details of how the `Event` class is implemented.

#### Implementation

For this feature, the `Event` class is implemented to store the event's name, date,
start time, end time, persons involved and groups involved.

<img src="images/EventClassDiagram.png" alt="EventClassDiagram" width=600 />

#### Design considerations

- Events stores a list of `Name` and a list of `Group` that are involved in the event. 
This is to facilitate the ability to track persons and groups involved in the event.
The `Name` class is used to represent the name of the person involved in the event, as names are unique in the `UniquePersonList`.
- We have also made `Event` an abstract class so as to increase extensibility of FumbleLog in the future. For now, when an event is created (i.e. using the `AddEventCommand`), it defaults to adding a `Meeting` into FumbleLog's `Event` List. Future support for other kinds of `Event` can be possible (i.e. Recurring event) by directly inheriting from `Event`.
- To track events, we implement an `EventList` to store all events to be displayed in FumbleLog.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Ability to assign/unassign persons from an event

#### Implementation

- The ability to assign a `Person` to an `Event` is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
- Each `Event` stores a list of person assigned to it. 
The person(s) are represented by their `Name` stored in FumbleLog. 
This is because the `Name` is the only unique identifier for a person.
- When a person is assigned to an event, the person's `Name` is added to the `Event`'s list 
of assigned persons. 
  - When a `Person` is unassigned from an `Event`, the person's `Name` is 
removed from the `Event`'s list of assigned persons. 
  - When a person's `Name` is modified, the change is also reflected in the event(s) 
  that they are previously assigned to.
- Users can assign multiple names to an event by using multiple `n/` identifiers following 
with the `Name` specified. The `ModelManager` will perform checks on whether the names supplied are valid, 
i.e the `Name` currently exists in FumbleLog.
- When editing the event, specifying `n/` with a `Name` will append this new name to the current list rather than replace the previous names. 
This is to facilitate the user to assign more persons without accidentally deleting the previous persons assigned. 
  - To un-assign a `Person`, the user must manually specify `u/` with the `Name` to un-assign the `Person` from the `Event`.
  - The `ModelManager` will perform checks on whether the names supplied are valid,
    i.e the `Name` currently exists in FumbleLog, and that the `Name` is currently assigned to the `Event`.

[Scroll back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Ability to assign groups to an event

#### Implementation

- The ability to assign a `Group` to an `Event` is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
- Each `Event` stores a list of `Groups` assigned to it. 
  - That is, when a `Group` is assigned to an `Event`, a `Group`object is stored a `Set` of `Group`. 
  - When un-assigned, the corresponding groups are then removed from the `Set`.
- To make it easier for the users to assign groups, this action is done through the `AddEventCommand` and `EditEventCommand`, with the `g/` prefix.
  - Users can assign multiple groups to an event by using multiple `g/` identifiers following
    with the `Group` specified. The `ModelManager` will perform checks on whether the names supplied are valid,
    i.e the `Group` currently exists in FumbleLog.
- To un-assign a `Group`, the user must manually specify `ug/` with the `Group` to un-assign it from the `Event`.
  - The `ModelManager` will perform checks on whether the groups supplied are valid,
    i.e the `Group` currently exists in FumbleLog, and that the `Group` is currently assigned to the `Event`.
- With the `Group` name, person(s) with that specific `Group` in their `Group` list is displayed with the `Event`.
- After a `Group` has been assigned to an `Event`, all `Person` in that `Group` will be displayed with the `Event` on FumbleLog.

A successful `EditEventCommand` that assigns groups should look like this:

<img src="images/AssignGroupsSequenceDiagram.png" alt="AssignGroup" width=600 />

This is a possible object representation of an `Event` with a `Group` and a `Person` assigned to it.

<img src="images/EditEventObjectDiagram.png" alt="AssignGroup" width=600 />

- In this object diagram, the `Event`, `TP meeting` has a `Person`, John, assigned to it and a `Group` CS2103T assigned to it. 
- In this case, TP meeting only stores these information and will use its respectively `Person` list and `Group` list to display:
  - John as assigned to it
  - Bob and Alice as assigned to it within a group.

#### Design considerations

- When adding and displaying groups, persons that has been added individually previously will be displayed twice. To counter that, checks are done to ensure that
when a group is added, duplicate persons will be deleted from the individual persons list
- A person can belong to multiple groups, due to the multiplicity between groups and persons. In this case, we allow multiple persons to be displayed, as it is clear which group they belong to.
- As the persons are searched by their group name only when displaying, adding new persons, editing and deleting persons is simple as the component just reloads and searches for everybody in the groups again.

### Ability to find persons and events

The `find_XYZ` commands in our application displays persons and/or events that fit the keyword(s).

#### Implementation

The original `find` command has been split into three new commands, `find_person`, `find_event`, and `find_all`, which
are collectively called `find_XYZ` commands.
* `find_person` command allows the user to find persons with fitting name or groups.
* `find_event` command allows the user to find events with fitting name, assigned persons and groups, or person under assigned groups.
* `find_all` command allows the user to find persons and events, which includes the criteria mentioned above.

The `find_person` command involves checking the current full list of persons and filtering out persons with fitting names 
or groups. This is done using `PersonNameOrGroupContainsKeywordsPredicate`, which enhanced from the original 
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` class. The predicate is then passed to `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)`.

Meanwhile, the `find_event` command involves checking the current full list of events and filtering out event with fitting names, groups or persons.
This is done using `EventNameOrGroupContainsKeywordsPredicate`, which also enhanced from `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` 
class. The predicate is then passed to `Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate<Event> predicate)`.

`find_all` command covers the mechanism of both commands mentioned above, which uses both predicates and calls both functions in `Model`.

As a result, the `ObservableList<Person>` and/or `ObservableList<Event>` are updated with the filtered lists of persons and events.
The `UI` component is notified of these new changes to the lists and updates the UI accordingly, which will show the updated lists.

#### Feature details

1. The `find_XYZ` commands can accept one or more parameter `keyword` for searching persons and/or events.
2. A `PersonNameOrGroupContainsKeywordsPredicate` and/or `EventNameOrGroupContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be created and a `FindXYZ` command will be created with the predicates.
3. The `FindXYZ` command will then be executed and the `UI` will be updated with the filtered lists of persons and/or events.

The flow for the `find_XYZ` commands are described by the following sequence diagrams:

#### `find_person`
![FindPersonSequenceDiagram](images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

#### `find_event`
![FindEventSequenceDiagram](images/FindEventSequenceDiagram.png)

#### `find_all`
![FindAllSequenceDiagram](images/FindAllSequenceDiagram.png)

#### General design considerations

**Aspect: Keyword target differentiation**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice): Find all persons that fits the keyword.**
    - Pros:
        - Easier to implement.
    - Cons:
        - Might get unwanted results, which decreases overall experience.
- **Alternative 2: Differentiate the target of keyword with syntax.**
    - Pros:
        - User can find exact person or group.
    - Cons:
        - Adding constraint the original command by requiring syntax, which may cause convenience.

### Remind feature

The `remind` command in our application displays a birthdays and events that will happen within a specified number of days.

#### Implementation

The `remind` feature involves checking the current filtered list of persons and events and filtering out persons with birthdays and events with starting date
that are within the specified number of days. This is done using `BirthdayWithinDaysPredicate` and `EventWithinDaysPredicate` which implements the `Predicate<T>` interface. These predicates are passed
to `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate)` and `Model#updateFilteredEventList(Predicate<Event> predicate)` respectively.

As a result, the `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Event>` are updated with the filtered lists of persons and events respectively.
The `UI` component is notified of these new changes to the lists and updates the UI accordingly, which will show the updated persons and events.

The `remind` command is implemented this way as it reuses the logic for the `find` command where it utilises the `Model` component to update the current list of persons based on the given predicate.
Instead of filtering out persons based on names, the `BirthdayWithinDaysPredicate` filters out persons based on their birthdays and the `EventWithinDaysPredicate` filters out events based on their starting dates.

The flow for the `remind` command is described by the following sequence diagram:

![RemindSequenceDiagram](images/RemindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Feature details
1. The `remind` command can accept an optional parameter `days` which specifies the number of days to search for birthdays and events. If `days` is not specified, the default value of 7 days will be used.
2. The application will validate the argument `days` to ensure that it is a positive integer. If it is not, an error message will be shown to the user and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If it is a valid input, a `BirthdayWithinDaysPredicate` and `EventWithinDaysPredicate` will be created and a `Remind` command will be created with the predicates.
4. The `Remind` command will then be executed and the `UI` will be updated with the filtered lists of persons and events.

#### General design considerations

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice): Updating list with predicate.**
    - Pros:
        - Reuses the logic of the original `find` command.
        - The `UI` component is notified of the changes to the list and updates the UI accordingly.
    - Cons:
        - The `Model` component is tightly coupled with the `UI` component.
- **Alternative 2: Checking current list for birthdays and events, and adding to new list.**
    - Pros:
        - Easier to implement.
    - Cons:
        - Performance overhead. New addressbook objects needs to be created.

## **Proposed Features**

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete_person 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete_person` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete_person 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add_person n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add_person` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list_all`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list_all`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add_person n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete_person`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

This product is targeted at busy university students who struggle to manage
their interpersonal relationships and commitments due to the demands of their
academic and social lives. They are relatively tech savvy and prefer to use the
keyboard over the mouse, prefer short commands over full sentences. 
These users seek an intuitive and efficient solution to help them stay organized,
prioritize their tasks and manage their time effectively.

**Value proposition**:

We provide students with an easy-to-use application to manage their social lives and 
time better. Our app reminds students of their upcoming commitments and helps them to
prioritize their tasks. It also helps them to keep track of their friendsâ€™ birthdays and
other important events.
