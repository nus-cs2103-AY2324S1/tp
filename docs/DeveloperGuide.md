## **Design**


### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), and all `Course` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCourseList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, user preference data and courses data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `CoursesStorage`, which means it can be treated as any of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Availability Feature

**API** : [`FreeTime.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/availability/FreeTime.java)

#### Implementation

To find a suitable replacement TA, the user needs to know the availability of the TAs.
As such we need to have classes that represent the time and availability.

`TimeInterval` is used to represent a period of time.
A `TimeInterval` is only considered valid if the end time is after the start time.


`FreeTime` is used to represent a TA's availability in the week.
We assume that TAs are only available during weekdays, so each `FreeTime` consist of 5
`TimeInterval`s where each `TimeInterval` represents a day in the week.

The following class diagram illustrates the structure of `FreeTime`.

![FreeTimeClassDiagram](images/FreeTimeClassDiagram.png)

`EMPTY_FREE_TIME` will be assigned to TAs that do not have availability information.

Valid input to `FreeTime#getDay(day)` are integers from [1,5] where 1 represents Monday, 2 represents Tuesday and so on.

`TimeInterval#GetFrom()` and `TimeInterval#GetTo()` represents the string representation of time in `HH:mm` format.

### Finding TA feature

#### Implementation

The finding TA feature allows users to search for a specific TA, using various filters
such as name, course and free time. With this feature, users can easily search for TAs
that fall under a certain set of filters.

To key in the command, type `find n/alex c/cs2103t d/1 from/12:00 to/14:00`. This will
search for all TAs with the name `alex` and course `cs2103t` that are free from `12:00`
to `14:00` on Monday.

The following sequence diagram displays how the finding TA feature is implemented.

![FindDiagram](images/FindDiagram.png)

### Teaching course Feature

#### Implementation

The teaching course feature allows users to enter the specific course they are teaching
and store the information in `UserPrefs`. With this feature, users can easily browse
through the list of TAs teaching under them.

To key in the command, type `teach t/courseName`. This will set the default teaching
course for the users and save it in UserPrefs.

Hence, the next time users log into TAManager, the page will automatically display the
TAs teaching under the users' course.

The following sequence diagram displays how the teaching course feature is implemented.

![TeachingDiagram](images/TeachingDiagram.png)

### Updating Hour Feature

#### Implementation

The updating hour feature allows users to update hours for all the TAs in the current list.
This feature allows users to easily update the working hours for TAs in batches. This feature
can be applied concurrently with the `find` command allowing users to update working hours for
filtered target users.

To key in the command, type `hour 10`. This will increase the working hours of all TAs in the
current list by 10, while others not showing in the list will not be changed. Similarly, users
can type `hour -10` and hours for TAs in the current users will be decreased by 10. The updated
hour must be within the valid range(0 - 9999).

The following sequence diagram displays how updating hour Feature is implemented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**
Overall, we are satisfied with our work in the team project and believe that we have put in a commensurate 
amount of effort to 5 individual projects.

The following are some of our achievements:

1. Successfully adding and replacing simple fields (e.g. Telegram)

Difficulty: **Easy**

We started with these tasks to familiarise ourselves with the codebase and workflow.
Overall, it was not difficult to add or remove simple fields, but there was some effort 
in finding all instances of the field and updating them accordingly.

2. Successfully adding the FreeTime field and corresponding findft command

Difficulty: **Moderate**

The representation of TAs' availability went through several iterations, especially
with regards to how ot save the day of week. We eventually settled on using an array
in the FreeTime object. The findft command had to be implemented from scratch in 
finding TAs with the correct availability.

3. Successfully implementing hour tracking features

Difficulty: **Moderate**

Though the Hour field is just a simple field, the hour command required us to work
with the FilteredPersonList to update the hours of all TAs in the list. 

4. Successfully representing courses in our app

Difficulty: **Hard**

This was the most challenging task as we had to come up with new architecture to
model a Course with its corresponding details and Lessons. It was also challenging
to navigate the storage system to create a `courses.json` file which advanced users
could edit to add their own courses. While AB3 deals with only one entity type, 
TAManager deals with two types which were also linked to each other.

5. Successfully implementing default course features

Difficulty: **Moderate**

The default course feature required us to dive into the architecture of UserPrefs
and the startup logic of the app. We had to ensure that the default course was
saved and loaded correctly, and that the list of TAs was filtered correctly.

6. Ensuring consistency between our product and the UG/DG

Difficulty: **Easy**

We went through many iterations of the UG and DG based on our own testing and 
feedback from others. We wanted to make sure that the information they contained 
are accurate and consistent with our product. Though it was not difficult, 
it was a time-consuming process.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### 1. Add Course Command

- **Enhancement:** Add a new command to allow users to add courses instead of directly modifying the `courses.json` file.
- **Reason:** This is to avoid direct manipulation of data, and actions on data by users should be handled by TAManager software.
- **Examples:** `addCourse CS2109S` will add `CS2109S` as a course.


### 2. Limit character length for TA fields

- **Enhancement:** Limit the character length for various fields for TAs to ensure data and UI consistency.
- **Reason:** To uphold an organized format for inputting data and avoid excessively lengthy entries that might impact the system's presentation and user-friendliness.
- **Examples:**
    1. **Name**: Limit to 1 - 50 characters to ensure the name has appropriate length.
    2. **Tags**: Limit to 1 - 50 characters to ensure the tag meanings are valid but not too long to impact UI presentations.
