## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="281" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/AddressBookClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

* Note: For the Person class, fields such as "Name", "Email" and "Phone" have been integrated into Person_Fields to
simplify the diagram. The Person_Fields class does not exist and is meant to represent the less important fields in
Person, such as "Name", "Email" and "Phone" that have similar attributes.

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Module`, `Tutorial`, `Assignment` objects
(which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueModuleList`, `UniqueTutorialList`, `UniqueAssignmentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query)
as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`
that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* `Module`, `Tutorial` and `Assignment` objects are stored in a similar way, as a separate list that the UI
automatically updates as the data in the list changes. However, since the UI always shows all modules, tutorials and
assignments the user has (i.e. there is no filtering for Modules, Tutorials and Assignments), the list exposed to
outsiders is always guaranteed to be the full list of Modules, Tutorials or Assignments.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components
(as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/NewStorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Module-Tutorial Interaction

In NUS, modules are a unit of study, and most modules require students to participate in tutorials. Each
module with tutorials has one or more tutorials, but each tutorial is usually only for one module. Given that Teaching
Assistants usually only teach tutorials rather than a module as a whole, we considered only including tutorials in our
product, but decided against it because having both modules and tutorials allows for more convenient searching for
teaching assistants teaching multiple modules. This comes at the cost of having to maintain the multiplicity between
module and tutorials.

To better enable advanced users, the app automatically performs actions to maintain the multiplicity constraint rather
than force the user to type additional commands to maintain it. For example, the AddToTutorial command adds a
tutorial to a person and the corresponding module should they not have it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**
1. This project required the addition of two new models, one for Module and one for Tutorial, which required
understanding and creating multiple new files in each of the four components, UI, Logic, Model & Storage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Currently, the addToModule and addToTutorial command, when used on a user that already has the given module or tutorial, does not give an
error message. We intend to change this so that the commands when used on a user that already has the given
module/tutorial will now give the error message `User already has the given module` or
`User already has the given tutorial` respectively in the output box.
2. The addModule and addTutorial commands currently do not have a hard limit on the length of a module name or tutorial name.
As such, we intend to change this such that any input exceeding a reasonable length will give an error message `Module name is too long!` or
`Tutorial name is too long!`.
3. The addTutorial command accepts an empty string as tutorial name. We believe this is an invalid input that does not
provide much value to users, so we intend to change this so trying to make a tutorial with an empty tutorial name
now returns `Tutorial name cannot be empty!`
4. Only addition of assignments is available as of now. We intend to implement it so that editing, removal and searching for assignments
will be possible in the future. Also, integration with the respective tutorials and modules should also be able to be done.
5. Splitting each person in the contact book into various roles (e.g. Professor, Student) is also planned for a later date.
6. The addToTutorial and removeFromTutorial commands currently simply show the person they edit after success, with
`Edited Person: (person details)`. We intend to change this so that they show `Tutorial added` or `Tutorial deleted` respectively.
7. Currently, the attn command does not restrict the length on the lesson number provided. We intend to implement 
some form of length requirements and produce an error message `The lesson number provided is too short/long!` when the restrictions are violated.
