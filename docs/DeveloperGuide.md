## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

[↑ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="450"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[↑ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml"/>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[↑ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The `filter` command allows the user to display a list of students who fulfil all predicates specified within the command.

When the user enters a filter command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and returns a `FilterCommand`.

Each predicate entered by the user can be modelled by exactly one of the following classes: `StudentHasAddressPredicate`, `StudentHasEmailPredicate`, `StudentHasPhonePredicate`, `StudentIsGenderPredicate`, `StudentIsSecLevelPredicate`, `StudentNearestMrtIsPredicate` and `StudentTakesSubjectPredicate`. These predicates can be added to the `predicateList` field of type `StudentPredicateList` within each `FilterCommand` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `filter` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `filter s/Physics g/M`.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterSequenceDiagram" />

When the `FilterCommandParser` parses the arguments to the `FilterCommand`, it creates a `StudentPredicateList`, to which the relevant predicates specified within the command are added. For example, using the example command given above, the `StudentPredicateList` would consist of 2 predicates: a `StudentTakesSubjectPredicate` and a `StudentIsGenderPredicate`.
These predicates are then combined into a single `Predicate<Student>`, using the `and()` method from the `Predicate` interface.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `filter` command:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FilterActivityDiagram" width="300" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the predicates specified within a single `FilterCommand` should be combined:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Combine predicates using the `and()` method from the `Predicate` interface.
  * Pros:
    * More in line with what the user would expect from a `filter` command.
  * Cons:
    * Users would experience less flexibility when using the command (for instance, the command `filter s/Physics s/Chemistry` cannot be used to display students taking Physics and/or Chemistry at the tuition centre).
* Alternative 2: Combine predicates using the `or()` method from the `Predicate` interface.
  * Pros:
    * Greater flexibility for users when filtering the list of students.
  * Cons:
    * Less in line with users' expectations of a `filter` command; not as intuitive.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that more intuitive commands would be easier for users to learn and eventually master.

[↑ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Uplevel, Undolevel feature

#### Implementation

The `uplevel` command allows the user to increase the sec levels of all students by one and remove all sec 4 students.

The `undolevel` command allows the user to undo the `uplevel` command and revert the student records to be before previous `uplevel` operation since open application.

When the user enter an uplevel/undolevel command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user input and returns a `UpdateSecLevelCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `UpdateSecLevelCommand` works. In this example, the user is executing `uplevel`.

<puml src="diagrams/UpdateSecLevelSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UpdateSecLevelSequenceDiagram" />

When the `AddressBookParser` parses the argument, it creates either `UpdateSecLevelCommand(isUndo: false)` for `uplevel` or `UpdateSecLevelCommand(isUndo: true`) for `undolevel`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happen when a user executes a `UpdateSecLevelCommand`.

<puml src="diagrams/UpdateSecLevelActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UpdateSecLevelActivityDiagram" width="750" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How other commands executed after `uplevel` and before `undolevel` should be addressed.**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The other commands executed after `uplevel` and before `undolevel` will be invalid.
  * Pros:
    * To avoid conflict between those commands and `undolevel` command.
    * More in line with what the user expect from reverting student records state to be before an `uplevel` command.
  * Cons:
    * User will need to perform those "in-between" commands again.
* Alternative 2: Keep track of what the user have done after any `uplevel` command.
  * Pros:
    * User will not need to perform those "in-between" commands again after doing `undolevel` to undo the sec level update.
  * Cons:
    * Less in line with users' expectations of reverting student records state to be before an `uplevel` command.
    * May have conflict between those "in-between" commands and `undolevel` command. E.g., edit a student's sec level and then perform `undolevel`.
    * Decline in performance due to the need to keep track every operation after `uplevel`.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as undolevel is provided in case a user accidentally perform `uplevel` that the user didn't intend to. As such, we found that Alternative 1 is more in line of users' expectations and will not mess up the logic.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The `sort` command allows the user to sort the list of students by name in alphabetical order to enhance efficiency in searching.

When the user enters a sort command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and returns a `SortCommand`.

The predicate entered by the user can be modelled by the following class: `SortIn`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `sort in/ASC`.

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram" />

When the `SortCommandParser` parses the argument to the `SortCommand`, the argument is stored as an attribute of type SortIn in `SortCommand`.
This predicate is then passed into the current model, using the `updateSortedPersonList()` method.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `sort` command:

<puml src="diagrams/SortActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SortActivityDiagram" width="250" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the student list is sorted internally:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the student list in class `UniquePersonList` using method `sort`.
  * Pros:
    * Student list is sorted permanently, ensuring no repeated sorting needed in the next launch provided no new student is added or student's name is changed.
    * Enhance efficiency of looking through the student list, ensure no repeated sorting needed when doing consecutive commands such as `filter`.
  * Cons:
    * Users would be unable to view the unsorted student list again.
* Alternative 2: Sort the student list in class `ModelManager` using method `updateSortedPersonList`.
  * Pros:
    * Enable users to view the unsorted student list for every launch.
  * Cons:
    * Users have to re-sort the student list for every launch.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we insist on providing greater convenience.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Import feature

#### Implementation

The `import` command allows the user to import .csv files containing their students' data in one go so that they do not need to add them one-by-one.

When the user enters an import command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input using `ImportCommandParser` and returns a `ImportCommand`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `import` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `import student_data.csv`.

<puml src="diagrams/ImportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ImportSequenceDiagram" />

When the `ImportCommandParser` parses the arguments, it creates a list of `Student` objects using the data in the .csv file and passes the argument and the list into the `ImportCommand`. `ImportCommand` will then add the `Student` into the `AddressBook`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `import` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ImportActivityDiagram" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to separate the attributes correctly from the imported data**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Fixed column sequence for data in the imported .csv files.
  * Pros:
    * Students' data with comma such as address can be detected more easily and will not be split wrongly.
  * Cons:
    * Users would experience less flexibility when using the command (for instance, users need to ensure their column in their .csv files matches the sequence).
* Alternative 2: Flexible column sequence for data in the imported .csv files.
  * Pros:
    * Greater flexibility for users when importing students' data.
  * Cons:
    * Higher chance in wrong a splitting of students' data.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that a fixed format would be easier for users to remember and use in the .csv files.

[↑ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Table feature

#### Implementation
The `table` command allows users to generate a statistical table categorised by `gender`, `subject`, `sec level` or `enrol date`.

When the user enters a table command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and return a `TableCommand`.

Note that there is no specific TableCommandParser for `TableCommand` just like `ListCommand`, `ExitCommand` and `HelpCommand`. The `AddressBookParser` can parse and return a `TableCommand`directly.

The parameters entered by user expected for a table command are either `g/`, `s/`, `l/` or `d/`. When the `TableCommand` instance created by `AddressBookParser` executes, it will return the corresponding CommandResult. e.g. `GenderTableCommandResult` created when `table g/` is entered. This `XXXTableCommandResult` carries the counts for each category that will be used for generating the table.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `table` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `table s/`

<puml src="diagrams/TableSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="TableSequenceDiagram" />

As shown in the sequence diagram, when the `AddressBookParser` parses the arguments to the TableCommand, it creates a TableCommand instance by passing in `s/` as argument so that when this `TableCommand` execute, it will return a `SubjectTableCommandResult` instance as specified by `s/`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `table` command:

<puml src="diagrams/TableActivityDiagram.puml" alt="TableActivityDiagram" width="300" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How to parse the argument for table internally:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** parse inside `TableCommand` and return the corresponding `XXXTableCommandResult`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, more straightforward when the number of possible arguments is less.
  * Cons: May not be suitable when we want to create a complex statistical table, e.g. a two-dimensional table.

* Alternative 2: Create a CommandParser specifically for TableCommand.
  * Pros: Provides a good abstraction when we are dealing with two-dimensional table.
  * Cons: May be redundant when we only want to create a one-dimensional table and the number of possible categories is smaller.

* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that the table we intend to create so far is one-dimensional table and there are only four possible categories (`g/` for gender, `s/` for subject, `l/` for sec level and `d/` for enrol date).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Trend feature

#### Implementation
The `trend` command allows users to generate a statistical line graph, showing the trend of tuition enrolments of a specific year.

When the user enters a trend command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input using `TrendCommandParser` and returns a `TrendCommand`.

The parameters entered by user for a trend command are expected to be only `y/`. When the `TrendCommand` instance created by `AddressBookParser` executes, it will return a TrendCommandResult.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `trend` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `trend y/2023`

<puml src="diagrams/TrendSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="TrendSequenceDiagram" />

As shown in the sequence diagram, when the `TrendCommandParser` parses the arguments to the TrendCommand, it creates a TrendCommand instance by passing in `2023` as argument so that when this `TrendCommand` executes, the trend of tuition enrolments of 2023 will be shown.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `trend` command:

<puml src="diagrams/TrendActivityDiagram.puml" alt="TrendActivityDiagram" width="300" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How to parse the argument for trend internally:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a CommandParser specifically for TrendCommand.
  * Pros: Provides better abstraction.
  * Cons: May be redundant as we only need to parse a year string.

* Alternative 2: Parse inside `TrendCommand`.
  * Pros: Easier to implement, more straightforward and more intuitive.
  * Cons: Code might be messier and longer, errors are harder to be handled.

* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we found that the creating a TrendCommandParser specifically for TrendCommand has cleaner code, handles error better, and it is generally a better practice.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Export feature

#### Implementation

The `export` command allows the user to export a visual representation recently created, be it a table, bar chart or line graph.

When the user enters an export command, the `AddressBookParser` parses the user's input and returns a `ExportCommand`.

The predicate entered by the user can be modelled by the following class: `Visual`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `export` command works. In this example, the user is executing the following command: `sort in/ASC`.

<puml src="diagrams/ExportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ExportSequenceDiagram" />

When the `ExportCommandParser` parses the argument to the `ExportCommand`, the argument is stored as an attribute of type Visual in `ExportCommand`.
This predicate is then passed into the current model, using the `export()` method.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `export` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ExportActivityDiagram" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where to export the image to:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow users to manually choose the destination in GUI to export the image to using method `exportAsPng`.
  * Pros:
    * Users could confidently navigate into the intended folder to save the image.
  * Cons:
    * Users have to use touchpad or a mouse to navigate around the folders.
* Alternative 2: Allow users to type in the path to the intended folder to save the image.
  * Pros:
    * Users would not need to find a touchpad or a mouse to use the GUI.
  * Cons:
    * It takes more time for a user to find out the exact path to save the image.
    * Getting the exact path is troublesome and significantly drains convenience.
    * Getting a small typo in the path is frustrating.
* We made the choice of Alternative 1 over Alternative 2 as we insist on providing greater convenience.

[↑ Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* Alternative 2: Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**
If the implementation effort required to create AB3 from scratch is 10, we estimate that the effort we spent to create
Tutorium is 11.

### Difficulty level
Over the course of this project, each of us had to make design decisions when implementing the features we were
responsible for. For instance, the implementation of the filter feature involved the creation of several classes, each
representing a single predicate which could be used to filter the list of students. This was something we found challenging
as it was the first time most of us needed to make such choices. Hence, creating Tutorium was not an easy task by any means.

### Challenges faced
At the beginning of the project, we needed to refactor existing code from AB-3 by adding additional fields in order to
create our Student class from the original Person class. This resulted in dependencies, as we needed to wait for
the relevant refactoring to be complete before we could work on further enhancements and new features.
Learning how to use JavaFX to create new windows to display visuals such as graphs, charts and tables was
something we had to grapple with as well due to the steep learning curve. Furthermore, it involved UI changes,
which we could only test manually.

### Effort required
Tutorium was built upon AB-3 over a period of 5-6 weeks by our team. Overall, the 5 of us put in
our best effort to build a product that was optimised for our target user, tuition centre administrative staff, by
brainstorming suitable features and enhancements to add.
Every week, each of us would spend around 1-2 days adding our respective features. Furthermore, we also wrote automated
JUnit tests at each stage, expending plenty of effort on crafting a good variety of test cases to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our tests.

### Achievements
Listed below are the enhancements we managed to add into Tutorium.
* Sort and filter features to aid users in organising student data.
* Import feature to help users transition easily from other student management applications.
* Data visualisation features (bar charts, tables and line graphs) added to enable users to conduct analysis on student data.
* Secondary school level (sec level) updating, to optimise the process of increasing students' sec levels at the beginning of each academic year.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
* Improving the phrasing of messages displayed to the user.
  * Currently, some messages displayed to the user (such as error messages or success messages) are
    phrased awkwardly. We plan to rephrase these messages to provide a smoother experience for the user.
* Include validity checks for the nearest MRT station field.
  * At the moment, Tutorium accepts any user input for the nearest MRT station field, which can lead to
    incorrectly-entered data in the case of user error. In the future, we will introduce validity checks
    to reduce the likelihood of such mistakes.
* Disallow the use of invalid character inputs in the search command.
  * Although only alphanumeric names are allowed, the search command allows the user to search for names
     containing non-alphanumeric characters. Our team plans to improve the design of this feature by
     disallowing such inputs in a future version of the product.
* Add a validation check to the phone number field to accept only phone numbers with 8 digits.
  * Valid phone numbers in Singapore are 8 digits long, but Tutorium accepts any number that is longer than 3 digits, even
    if it would be considered an invalid phone number. We will add a validation check to restrict inputs to 8-digit phone numbers
    in future versions of the app.
* Standardise prefix for year in data visualisation features.
  * In the table and chart feature, the prefix used to indicate the year is `d/`, but for the line graph feature, it is `y/`. We
    plan to standardise the prefix used to `y/` to make these commands more intuitive and easier to learn.
