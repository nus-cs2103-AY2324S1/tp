### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ManageHrParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an employee).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ManageHrParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ManageHrParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Employee` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEmployeeList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Employee` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Department` list in the `ManageHr`, which `Employee` references. This allows `ManageHr` to only require one `Department` object per unique tag, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Department` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ManageHrStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Employee management

#### The employee class

![Employee Class Diagram](images/ManageHR/EmployeeClassDiagram.png)

ManageHR keeps track of employees within the company with the use of `Employee` and `UniqueEmployeeList`. The `UniqueEmployeeList` serves as a container for the `Employee` objects
within the company, while enforcing the constraints that no 2 employees can have the same name.

The `Employee` class contains the following attributes.

1. `EmployeeName`: The name of the employee.
2. `Email`: The email of the employee.
3. `Address`: The home address of the employee.
4. `Leave`: The amount of leave remaining for the employee.
5. `Salary`: The monthly salary accorded to the employee.
6. `Phone`: The phone number of the employee.
7. `Role`: The role of the employee.
8. `Superiors`: The employee name of the superior in charge of them.
9. `Departments`: A set of departments in which the employee can belong.

All the attributes except Departments and Superiors are compulsory fields.

### List command

#### Overview

The `ListCommand` displays all the `Employee` objects currently stored in `UniqueEmployeeList` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the different components of ManageHR interact with each other.

<img src="images/ManageHR/ListSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

The above sequence diagram omits details on the internal implementations within each directory in order to improve
overall readability of the diagram.

### Help command

#### Overview

The `HelpCommand` displays help for the current command.
- `help <Command>`
  - example: `help add`
  - expected: Shows functionality for `add` in the help window.
  - Shows the same content as the user guide.
- `help`
  - example: `help'
  - expected: Displays a link to the user guide.
  - Shows the same content as the user guide.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the possible outputs of the help command.
![](images/helpSequenceDiagram.png)


**Design considerations:**

Basic functionality of referring to the online user guide should always be retained.
However, due to a host of reasons, the online guide may not be available to our target user.
As such, offline help is required, by the means of a quick reference with the `help <command>` function.

This help function is intended as a quick reference guide to the user, rather than a comprehensive reference document.
It is intended to simulate `man` pages in linux, with very simple guides as to how command syntax should be applied.
Examples are also provided for the quick reference of the user, and are intended to work on the default ManageHR sample.

When presenting users with help, syntax and examples need to be provided to the user.
The Copy URL button used for the general help can be repurposed to support the quick copying of an example command.
The example command is now separated from the usage in each command, to allow for quick delivery of the example.

**Adding additional Command:**

Upon the addition of a new Command, registration has to occur in ManageHRParser.
This involves adding a new case to both the parser, and the command use checker.
By default, this should return the `MESSAGE_USAGE` and `MESSAGE_EXAMPLE`.
`MESSAGE_EXAMPLE` should be something that can be copy-pasted into the command line.

**Mechanism of Action:**

In order for the help window to be called, the mechanism of the window had to be modified.
Previously the window just defocused itself upon the user clicking away from it.
This method results in the window being static, and built upon the launch of ManageHR, with
limited abilities to re-designate text within the window.

This was solved by closing the window, before re-building and re-focusing the window at every stage.
Upon typing the help command with no arguments, the default text would change to a link to the User Guide,
as well as a quick link to copy said user guide.
After typing a help command together with a Command to discover help for, the help window is closed,
before text is regenerated, and the button's label is modified to copy examples. The text is then changed to the
`MESSAGE_USAGE` of the Command, and the text is modified to "Copy Example".
The button is now configured to copy `MESSAGE_EXAMPLE`, for the quick reference of the user.


### Delete feature
The delete feature allows employees to be deleted with just a simple index.
-   `delete <index>`
    - example: `delete 4`
    - expected: Deletes employee with the current index of 4.
    - Shows successful deletion of employee.

A sequence diagram of this deletion is shown below.
![](images/DeleteEmployeeSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design Considerations:**

The delete command is an essential part of the CRUD process. As such, this is the first few items to implement in ManageHR.
Initially with barebones functions, each employee effectively had an ID assigned on when they joined ManageHR.
However, this design has changed, due to the implementation of the filter function, where IDs are no longer unique.
ManageHR now has to be aware of the state of the program, if there are any filters active, and the IDs and people being shown to the user.

The deletion of an employee is relatively easy compared to the deletion of a department. The removal of an employee does not do any updates
to the department, as there is only unidirectional dependencies of an employee to a department. No update is required to any departments upon the departure of the last employee.


**Mechanism of Action:**

This feature is implemented by first modifying the ID state to use ParserUtil to host the current state, and get the current index's validity at the given state.
Following that, the parser is able to extract out the appropriate employee to refer to. A DeleteCommand is then created, ready to execute.
Upon calling execute, the Model returns a filtered employee list, and the deletion is done by the model.
On completion, a command result is thrown back with the appropriate success/failure values.


### Filter command

The filter command filters employees by prefixes/parameters.

Format: `filter [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [s/SALARY] [l/LEAVE] [r/ROLE] [m/MANAGER_NAME] [d/DEPARTMENT]`

* The filter is case-sensitive. e.g. `R&D` will not match `r&d`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Able to filter by multiple prefixes

Examples:
* `filter d/investment` returns employees with the `investment` department
* `filter s/4000` returns employees with salary equal to or less than 4000
* `filter l/14 r/manager` returns employees with 14 days of leave and the manager role


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the filter command, the Activity Diagrams
are split into two part to ensure clarity/visibility of the diagrams, however the activities occur simultaneously:

![FilterActivityDiagramPart1](images/FilterActivityDiagramPart1.png)

![FilterActivityDiagramPart2](images/FilterActivityDiagramPart2.png)

The following is the filter feature's class diagram, illustrating the interaction between the FilterCommand,
FilterCommandParser and the ContainsAllPredicate classes.

![FilterCommandClassDiagram](images/FilterCommandClassDiagram.png)

### Department feature

The department feature allows users to manage department using a single command
- `department t/TYPE n/NAME`
    - TYPE corresponds to the type of action to be taken
    - example 1: `department t/add n/R&D`
    - expected 1: add a department with the name R&D
    - example 2: `department t/delete n/R&D`
    - expected 2: delete the department with the name R&D

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the filter command:

![DepartmentActivityDiagram](images/DepartmentActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

Copy the current ManageHR json file into a backup, with the appropriate name.
Load a new sample copy of ManageHR's data file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample employees. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Help function
1. Calling help
   1. With ManageHR open, type `help` into the command line.
        Expected: A help window containing a link to the user guide, and a copy button shows.

2. Calling help with a custom command.
   1. With ManageHR open, type `help add` into the command line.
        Expected: A help window containing syntax, as well as an example should be visible to the user. The UI should be scaled such that everything can be seen. The copy button now takes on the command example.

### Deleting an employee

1. Deleting an employee while all people are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all employees using the `list` command. Multiple employees in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First employee is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted employee shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No employee is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Filtering

1. Filter by `department`

   1. Prerequisites: Employees need to have department tags

   1. Test case: `filter d/R&D`<br>
      Expected: Only employees with `R&D` department tag are shown.

   1. Test case: `filter d/aaosijflk`<br>
      Expected: No such department tag found. No employee is shown. Error details shown in the status message.

2. Filter by `salary`

   1. Prerequisites: Employees need to have salary assigned

   1. Test case: `filter s/4000`<br>
      Expected: Employees with salary less than or equal to 4000 are shown.

   2. Test case: `filter s/alsjl`<br>
      Expected: Incorrect parameter. Not an integer. No employee is shown. Error details shown in the status message.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Modify `ManageHr.json` illegally. This is by adding illegal json tags, or destruction of the json structure.
   2. ManageHR will sense an issue, and replace the working file with the sample dataset.

### Planned Enhancements

1. Functional Updates

    1. Able to display the list of departments
    2. Each department may have additional constraints eg. having supervisors and subordinate roles tied to a particular department
    3. Able to display the manager-subordinate relationship in the profile details of each employee

2. UI improvements/

    1. Addition of a tab of buttons to toggle between viewing employees & departments. This is necessary as the small window of our current UI may not be able to contain all useful information without being too cluttered
    2. Display managers of each employee as a list of names under the profile of each employee. This is desirable as users would be able to more easily pinpoint the relationship between the employees in the list.
    3. Display the role (manager/subordinate) of each employee as a separate tag for each employee in the list.
    4. Color scheme changes. Cosmetic update in sync of the UI mock-up.
