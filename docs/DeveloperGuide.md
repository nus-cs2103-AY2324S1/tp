### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `ScheduleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the tutee data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Tuition Connect data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature
The `AddCommand` extends the `Command` class. While mostly similar to `delete` illustrated above, the command contains
checks to prevent any duplicate `Person` object (i.e. same name and phone number) as well as clashes in schedules.
If it passes these checks, the person is added into the system.

`AddCommand` takes in the following fields:
* **Name (Compulsory field)**: String composed of character between A-Z and a-z.
* **Phone number (Compulsory field)**: Any number at least 3 digits long.
* **Email (Compulsory field)** String with restrictions in characters (XXXXXXXX@emaildomain)
* **Address (Compulsory field)**: String without restriction in characters.
* **Subject (Compulsory field)**: String without restriction in characters.
* **Day (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions in characters, non-case sensitive (Mon/Monday/Tue/Tuesday/Wed/Wednesday/Thu/Thursday/Fri/Friday/Sat/Saturday/Sun/Sunday).
* **Begin (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions (HHMM).
* **End (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions (HHMM).
* **PayRate (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions in characters, only numbers allowed (no negative numbers)

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works.

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How add executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All fields must be included in a single command input.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Command input may be too long and less user-friendly.

* **Alternative 2**: Allow for optional parameters with default values, with the tutee's name and phone being the compulsory ones.
    * Pros: More user-friendly, command will not be too lengthy.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

### List feature

There are three commands that deal with listing tutees:

1. `ListCommand` - Shows the current list of all tutees in the list
2. `ListByDayCommand` - Shows the current list of tutees who have lessons on a specified day
3. `ListUnPaidCommand` - Shows the current list of tutees who have not paid

The `ListCommand` extends the `Command` class. Both the `ListByDayCommand` and the `ListUnPaidCommand` extend the `ListCommand` class. All three commands override `Command#execute`.
The `ListCommandParser` is responsible for returning the appropriate `ListCommand`  based on the command format.



The `ListByDayCommand`  is initialised with a `DayPredicate` and updates the `FilteredPersonList` to only display Persons whose `Day` field matches the specified input.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list by day command works.

![ListByDaySequenceDiagram](images/ListByDaySequenceDiagram.png)

The `ListUnPaidCommand`  follows a similar implementation to `ListByDayCommand`. It is initialised with a `PaidPredicate` instead and updates
the `FilteredPersonList` to only display Persons whose `isPaid` field is false.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to implement `ListByDayCommand` and `ListUnPaidCommand`:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend the `ListCommand` class.
    * Pros: Greater use of OOP.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command class without extending `ListCommand`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Less abstraction.

### Find feature
The `FindCommand` extends the `Command` class. It allows the user to find for tutees by specifying their names and/or
subject using their prefixes. Both parameters are optional, but at least one of them must be specified for the `find`
command to work properly.

`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` is a class which takes a list of strings as input, and is used to test whether the input
matches any of the names inside the tutee list.

`SubjectContainsKeywordsPredicate` is a class which takes a list of string as input, and is used to test whether the input
matches any of the subjects inside the tutee list.

As for `NameSubjectPredicate`, it takes in two parameters `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and 
`SubjectContainsKeywordsPredicate` as to accommodate for both input of fields n/ and sb/.

However, since the method `updateFilteredPersonList` can only take one parameter, the merging of both 
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `SubjectContainsKeywordsPredicate` into `NameSubjectPredicate` is the implementation
we decided to go with.

`FindCommand` takes in the following fields:
* **Name (Optional field)**: String composed of character between A-Z and a-z.
* **Subject (Optional field)**: String without restriction in characters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit command works.
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How find executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find tutees based on inputs for prefixes n/ and sb/.
    * Pros: More sophisticated as it can search for subjects rather than only for name.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly for beginners as it requires an extra step of inputting prefixes.
* **Alternative 2:** Find tutees based on their name.
    * Pros: More user-friendly as the command format would only be `find [name]`.
    * Cons: Users cannot search for tutees by subject.

### Edit feature
The `EditCommand` extends the `Command` class. It allows the user to edit fields of the tutee by specifying the index
of the tutee. The command contains checks to prevent any duplicate `Person` object (i.e. same name and phone number)
as well as clashes in schedules. If it passes these checks, the person is edited successfully.

`EditCommand` takes in the following fields:
* **Index (Compulsory Field)**: Numbers between 1 to the number of people inside the list.
* **Name (Optional field)**: String composed of character between A-Z and a-z.
* **Phone number (Optional field)**: Any number at least 3 digits long.
* **Email (Optional field)** String with restrictions in characters (XXXXXXXX@emaildomain)
* **Address (Optional field)**: String without restriction in characters.
* **Subject (Optional field)**: String without restriction in characters.
* **Day (Optional field)**: String with restrictions in characters, non-case sensitive (Mon/Monday/Tue/Tuesday/Wed/Wednesday/Thu/Thursday/Fri/Friday/Sat/Saturday/Sun/Sunday).
* **Begin (Optional field)**: String with restrictions (HHMM).
* **End (Optional field)**: String with restrictions (HHMM).
* **PayRate (Optional field)**: String with restrictions in characters, only numbers allowed (no negative numbers)

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit command works.
![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit command:
![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How edit executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User specify which fields to edit by their prefixes.
    * Pros: User can edit the fields that require changes by specifying their prefix.
    * Cons: Command input may be too long and less user-friendly.
* **Alternative 2:** Users cannot edit tutees that are already added, and can only do delete and re-adding
  of tutees whenever changes are necessary.
    * Pros: Less prone to bugs, and is simpler for developers to implement.
    * Cons: Not user-friendly and takes multiple steps for the user.

### Find Free Time feature

The `freeTime` Command extends the `Command` class.

`freeTime` takes in the following fields:
* **Day (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions in characters, non-case sensitive (Mon/MondayTue/Tuesday/Wed/Wednesday/Thu/Thursday/Fri/Friday/Sat/Saturday/Sun/Sunday).
* **Duration (Compulsory field)**: Positive Integer to represent duration in **minutes**.
* **Begin (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions (HHMM).
* **End (Compulsory field)**: String with restrictions (HHMM).

It displays a list of timeslots where the user is free on that _Day_, starting from _Begin_ to _End_. The timeslots listed down
must also be greater than the duration provided.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `freeTime` command works.
![FreeTimeSequenceDiagram](images/FreeTimeSequenceDiagram.png)

Variables inside the sequence diagram:
* toFind, Interval: Both are instances of the `Interval` Class which encapsulates the `Day`, `Duration`, `Begin`, `End` fields
* results: A list of strings where the user is busy on the specified given `Interval` class.
* timeslots: A list of timeslots after parsing the list of strings.
* availableTime: A list of timeslots where the user is free.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `freeTime` command:
![FreeTimeActivityDiagram](images/FreeTimeActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How `freeTime` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The command first finds timeslots when the user is busy on that _Day_ by looking at the tutees' schedules inside the
  `UniquePersonList`. The TimeSlot Class finds free time based on the list of
  timeslots when the user is busy, and then returns a list of timeslots where the user is free. (Each timeslot is between _Begin_ and _End_,
  and is at least _Duration_ long)
    * Pros: Command is short and simple to use.
    * Cons: During the first round of user-testing, some new users were confused on how to use the command.


### Calculate monthly revenue


The `RevenueCommand` extends the `command class`. The command first gets a list containing all tutees.
The total monthly revenue can be calculated now by iterating through the list and calling `Person#getMonthlyFee`. <br>

The total monthly revenue is calculated as such: <br>
*Total Monthly Revenue* = Sum of every tutee's `monthlyFee`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `RevenueCommand` works:
![RevenueSequenceDiagram.png](images/RevenueSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How `monthlyFee` is calculated:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate `monthlyFee` only when executing `RevenueCommand`.
    * Pros: Up-to-date revenue figure as `PayRate` value and number of lessons monthly may change over time.
    * Cons: Potentially more method calls to generate same value.

* **Alternative 2:** Calculate `monthlyFee` when instantiating `Person` and include it as a field in `Person`.
    * Pros: Readily accessible `monthlyFee` value.
    * Cons: Have to implement logic to update `monthlyFee` when `PayRate` value and number of lessons monthly changes.


### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current tutee list state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous tutee list state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone tutee list state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial tutee list state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single tutee list state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the tutee list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the tutee list after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted tutee list state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified tutee list state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the tutee list state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous tutee list state, and restores the tutee list to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the tutee list to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest tutee list state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the tutee list, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all tutee list states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire tutee list.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Mark paid/unpaid features
The proposed mark paid/check paid mechanism can check whether the person has paid or not by implementing a new boolean field 'paid' in the person object, it implements the following operations:

* `paid [index]` — Mark the person at the index as paid.
* `unpaid [index]` — Mark the person at the index as not paid.
* `list unpaid` — List all the persons who haven't paid in the list.
* `unpaidAll` — Reset all students' payment status to not paid.

The following sequence diagram shows how paid command works:

![PaidSequenceDiagram.png](images/PaidSequenceDiagram.png)

The unpaid command works similar to the paid command.

The following sequence diagram shows how unpaidAll command works:

![UnpaidAllSequenceDiagram.png](images/UnpaidAllSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: The choice of paid data type:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use simple boolean value.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, fits the requirement: two status (paid, not paid).
    * Cons: Different from all other fields in the person class, hard to maintain.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new paid class.
    * Pros: Fits the other fields in the class.
    * Cons: Hard to implement, waste of source (such as code storage, might affect the efficiency of the code).

**Aspect: How to implement mark paid features:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new person, set everything else the same as before, and set paid as true.
    * Pros: Since we created a new person, the command works individually and not depends on the other commands.
    * Cons: Hard to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the edit command to edit the paid status of the person.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: The paid command will rely on the edit commands, which violates the principle to reduce correlation between classes.

## **Planned Enhancements**

### Batch Processing for Paid Command

Reason: This enhancement allows users to mark multiple persons as paid in a single command, improving efficiency.

Idea: Modify the paid command parser to accept a list of person identifiers (e.g., "paid 1, 2, 3"), and update the command execution logic to iterate through the list and mark each person as paid.

### Scheduled Unpaid Marking

Reason: Introduce a scheduling feature within the unpaid command to set future unpaid statuses for individuals. This would be beneficial for scenarios where payments should automatically lapse after a set period.

Idea: Add a scheduling mechanism within the command execution to mark individuals as unpaid after a specified future date or duration.

### Find using multiple keywords

Reason: To create a more sophisticated find feature for the best results. This enhancement allows users to get more specific results tailored to their criteria.

Idea: Modify the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `SubjectContainsKeywordsPredicate` to accept multiple word inputs (e.g. "find n/Alex Yeoh sb/Maths Chemistry).

### Maximum PayRate

Reason: `PayRate` that are extremely high may not be displayed properly by GUI and are unlikely to be realistic PayRates per hour anyway.

Idea: Modify the VALIDATION_REGEX of `PayRate` such that it only accepts values up to 9999.99.

### Prevent Commands meant to Modify Tutee Data from Not Changing the Data

Reason: `clear`,`edit`, `paid`, `delete`,`unpaidAll` are commands that deal with modifying tutee data. If the tutee's `isPaid` status is true,
the system permits the user to execute the `paid` command even though this will not change the `isPaid` status of the tutee. If these commands
do not change the tutee data in any way but still allowed to be executed, when the user executes `undo`, there will be no changes since there are now duplicate states of the `VersionedAddressBook`
is saved. The system should inform the user that this command will not modify any data and prevent the command from executing.

Idea: Create a `Model#isSameData()` to compare whether the state of the tutee data before and after the command execution will be the same. If
`Model#isSameData()` returns true, a `CommandException` should be thrown and the system should inform the user that this command will not modify any data.

### Enable Group Lessons

Reason: Current `Lesson` implementation prevents any lessons clashes, that is no two `Person` objects can have lessons that fall in same timeslots.
However, this is based on the assumption that lessons are carried out on a one-on-one basis. Given the possibility of group lessons, having such a feature
would allow for more flexibility in the application.

Idea: Create a `GroupTag` field for `Lesson` class which contain an ID for each `Lesson` object if they are group lessons. When checking if two 
lesson clashes, allow for lesson clash if `Lesson` objects have the same IDs which means they are the same group lesson.

### Enhance Edit Feature
Reason: Currently, the edit feature might result in a bug if the NAME and (DAY/BEGIN/END) fields are edited at the same time. 
For example, if tutee index 1 has the name John and has a lesson on Monday 20:00 - 21:00, trying to do `edit 1 n/Doe end/2030` 
will result in an error (throwing the message that this date clashes with an existing schedule). This is because it considers the
pre-edited tutee as a schedule clash.

Idea: Have an additional check with the index. If the edited person has the same index as the pre-edited person, then the
system should allow the edit to happen.

### Put more restrictions in phone number and email
Reason: Users might be able to put in an infinitely-long phone number and email which may cut off the UI

Idea: Add the restriction in the parsers.

### UI Enhancements when minimizing the window size
Reason: When the window is minimized, both the schedule list panel and the tutee list panel might be cut off.

Idea: Set a minimum width for the Main Window to ensure the UI is not cut off.
