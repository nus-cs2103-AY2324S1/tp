### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="100%" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<br>
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
<br>
<img src="images/Person&MeetingClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` and `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueMeetingList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `Meeting` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Meeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
- The Tag is a factory class that keeps its own HashMap of the Tags it has created before, thus it ensures that every Tag is unique and can be referenced by all Person and Meetings.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="100%" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit Contacts and Meetings feature

Both the edit contact command `editc` and edit meeting command `editm` are implemented quite similarly due to the similarities between the `Person` and `Meeting` classes.

This section shall therefore only go in deep detail for the implementation of the `editm` command. However, the `editc` equivalent of certain commands used by `editm` will be detailed, such that the implementation of `editc` can be fully derived.

The class diagrams for both edit commands differ from the other commands in that an additional `EditMeetingDescriptor` or `EditPersonDescriptor` class is used to create the commands. The diagram for `editm` is as seen below.

![EditMeetingClassDiagram](images/edit/EditMeetingClassDiagram.png)

To start off, both `editc` and `editm` take in an index as their first argument, which refers to a `Person` in the displayed person list, or a `Meeting` in the displayed meeting list respectively.

Next, both commands take in a variable number of optional arguments based on the arguments used by the `addc` and `addm` commands. This allows the user to input only the fields they wish to edit in the chosen `Person` or `Meeting` object, as opposed to having to type in every field.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Using `editm 3 m/Friend meetup a/Mall` as an example, when input by the user, an instance of an `EditMeetingCommand` (`EditCommand` in the case of `editc` with its respective `Person` fields as arguments) is created as shown in the following Sequence Diagram.

![CreateEditMeetingCommandSequenceDiagram](images/edit/CreateEditMeetingCommand-Create_EditMeetingCommand.png)

As seen above, before the `EditMeetingCommandParser` creates the `EditMeetingCommand` object, it first creates an instance of an `EditMeetingDescriptor` (`EditPersonDescriptor` in the case of `editc`). This descriptor stores the new information of the fields to be edited based on the user input. From our example, it would store the `Title: Friend meetup` and `Location: Mall`.

Once the instance of `EditMeetingCommand` is created, it is executed by the `LogicManager`. During execution, the current `Meeting` object referenced by the input index (3 in our example) is obtained from the meeting list returned by `getFilteredMeetingList`.

Next, a new instance of `Meeting` is created using the fields from the `EditMeetingDescriptor`. Any fields not present in the descriptor us obtained from the old `Meeting` object from the previous step, as these fields do not need to be edited. From our example, the `START`, `END`, `TAG` and `ATTENDEE_LIST` will be obtained from the current `Meeting` instance as the Descriptor only contains the `TITLE` and `LOCATION` fields.

Finally, the old `Meeting` object is replaced with the new instance, and the `ModelManager` is updated. These steps are denoted in the Sequence Diagram below.

![EditMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/edit/EditMeetingSequenceDiagram-Execute_EditMeetingCommand.png)

#### Design Considerations and Rationale

1. `editm` allows the user to edit every field of `Meeting` apart from the attendee list.
   - The commands `addmc` and `rmmc` are used to modify the attendee list of a meeting instead.
   - This retains the identity of the edit commands as commands that modify field information, as opposed to `addmc` and `rmmc` which can be seen as commands that link multiple objects together.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View Contacts and Meetings feature

#### Implementation

Just like the Edit commands, the view contact command `viewc` and the view meeting command `viewm` are implemented in the exact same way due to the similarities between the `Person` and `Meeting` classes.

As such, this section shall only detail the implementation of the `viewc` command. However, the implementation of `viewm` can be derived by replacing some `Person` related functions/classes/objects with its `Meeting` counterpart.

`viewc` and `viewm` both take in an index as their only argument, which refers to a `Person` in the displayed person list, or a `Meeting` in the displayed meeting list respectively.

Using `viewc 2` as an example, when input by the user, an instance of a `ViewContactCommand` (`ViewMeetingCommand` in the case of `viewm`) is created as shown in the following Sequence Diagram. This step does not differ from the way other commands have been shown to be created. The argument for our example would just be `2`, which would be stored as the `targetIndex` field of the `ViewContactCommand` object.

![CreateViewContactCommandSequenceDiagram](images/view/CreateViewContactCommand-Create_ViewContactCommand.png)

Once the instance of `ViewContactCommand` is created, it is executed by the `LogicManager`. During execution, the command stores the contents of its `targetIndex` field in the `ModelManager` using its `setViewedPersonIndex` method as shown in the next Sequence Diagram. For `ViewMeetingCommand` it would use the `setViewedMeetingIndex` method instead.

![StoreViewedItemsToModelDiagram](images/view/ViewCommandsSequenceDiagram-StoreViewedItemsToModel.png)

Once the indexes of the `Person` and `Meeting` objects to view (if any) are stored in `ModelManager`, their corresponding `Person` and `Meeting` objects (in this case the 2nd `Person` as displayed on the list) are obtained by the `MainWindow` as a `Pair` through the `getViewedItems` method of the `LogicManager` class. As such, both objects can then be forwarded to the `InfoDisplayPanel` using `setViewedModel`, which then displays detailed information of both objects. This process is denoted in the final Sequence Diagram below.

![ForwardViewedPersonMeetingtoUiDiagram](images/view/UiViewItemsSequenceDiagram-ForwardViewedPerson&MeetingToUi.png)
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations and Rationale

1. Passing viewed `Person` and `Meeting` from Model to Ui through Logic:
   - `ViewContactCommand` and `ViewMeetingCommand` only have access to the `ModelManager` while `MainWindow` only has access to `LogicManager`.
   - To prevent excessive and unnecessary coupling for the sake of two commands, it is deemed more worthwhile to use `LogicManager` as a proxy between `ModelManager` and `MainWindow`, especially since `LogicManager` already had access to `ModelManager`.
2. Storing the viewed `Person` and `Meeting` as fields in `ModelManager`:
   - The behaviour of `ModelManager` is not contradicted as it is already responsible for storing both the filtered lists of `Person` and `Meeting` objects that are displayed in the Ui.
3. Storing the `Index` of the viewed `Person` and `Meeting` rather than a copy of the objects directly:
   - Storing a copy of the objects was done initially but led to a display issue.
   - When the fields of any currently viewed item are edited, the display does not update as the copy of the original viewed item does not get updated as well.
   - Storing the `Index` fixes this issue as the `Person` and `Meeting` objects are only forwarded to the Ui after the execution of a command.
4. As a continuation to point 3, this leads to a new issue with commands that can modify the display list length/order such as `listc`, `editc`, `findc`, `deletec`, `addc` and their meeting variants.
   - Since the stored `Index` may now reference a different item, or even point out-of-bounds in the case of the display list being shortened, this implementation may potentially lead to unpredictable results for both view commands.
   - For the case of `addc`, `addm`, `listc`, `listm`, `editc` and `editm`, this is judged to not be an issue as the view commands still obey their definition of displaying the item at a specified list index.
     - For both edit commands, it is also more important that they can display dynamic updates.
   - For the case of `deletec`, `deletem`, `findc` and `findm`, the stored `Index` is set to null to prevent potential out-of-bounds error.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find meeting feature

#### Behaviour and Implementation

The find meeting command is facilitated by `GeneralMeetingPredicate` that by itself is the combined predicate for all the meeting data fields. It is placed within the Model component and is only dependent on other predicate classes and `Meeting`.

`findm` is supported by 5 sub-predicates that would search their respective fields.

- m/TITLE_KEYWORDS â€‰â€”â€‰ Finds meetings which `Title` contain any of the keywords given using `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
- a/LOCATION_KEYWORDS â€‰â€”â€‰ Finds meetings which `Location` contain any of the keywords given using `LocationContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
- n/ATTENDEE_KEYWORDS â€‰â€”â€‰ Finds meetings which set of `Attendee` contain any of the keywords given using `AttendeeContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
- t/TAG_KEYWORDS â€‰â€”â€‰ Finds meetings which set of `Tag` contain any of the keywords given using `TagContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
- s/START e/END â€‰â€”â€‰ Finds meetings that fall within the range of time given by START & END using `MeetingTimeContainsPredicate`. (Both START & END must come together)

All of these fields are optional and typing `findm` alone will not impose any predicates, except MeetingTimeContainsPredicate which will give the largest `LocalDateTime` range possible.

![FindMeetingClass](images/FindMeetingClass.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findm` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `findm m/meeting` command to find all meetings that have the keyword `meeting` in their title. This results in the logic component calling `parse` from the `AddressBookParser` object to make a `FindMeetingCommandParser` object. This will parse the arguments available and create the `GeneralPredicateMeeting` object and FindMeetingCommand object.

<img src = "images/FindMeetingSequence.png" width = "100%" />

Step 2. The `FindMeetingCommand` will be immediately executed and will call `setPredicate(GeneralMeetingPredicate)` from `Model`. The `GeneralMeetingPredicate` will be used on all meetings, meetings which pass all 5 predicates are shown in `MeetingSchedulePanel`. After which `FindMeetingCommand` and the predicate objects will no longer be referenced.

The following diagrams show the entire sequence flow for `LogicManager#execute()` for FindMeetingCommand.

<img src = "images/FindMeetingSequence2.png" width = "100%" />

**Find Contact is implemented in a similar manner.**

#### Design Considerations and Rationale

1. Given the amount of predicates `FindMeetingCommand` is supposed to use, every predicate needs to be combined in order to maintain good SLAP.
   - `GeneralMeetingPredicate` is made with the user input KEYWORDS, if there are no inputs for the predicate must return true.
   - If there are no inputs for s/START and e/END, `FindMeetingCommandParser` will give `MeetingTimeContainsPredicate` both `LocalDateTime.MAX` & `LocaLDateTime.MIN`
2. The coupling between predicate classes and `Logic` needs to be minimal as `FindMeetingCommandParser` should only be dependent on `GeneralMeetingPredicate` and `MeetingTime`.
   - `MeetingTime`is needed to check the validity of START and END in order for `parse()` to stop any invalid inputs, it cannot be removed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add attendee feature

User can specify a Person to add as an Attendee to a specified Meeting.

To avoid storing an entire `JsonAdaptedPerson` object within the `JsonAdaptedMeeting` every time a `Person` is added to a `Meeting`,
an `Attendee` class is created to store a unique identifier for the `Person` added.
As every `Person` has a unique name in the current iteration of OutBook, it is used as the unique identifier.
`Attendee` is implemented in the following way:

- `Attendee(attendeeName)` -- Initialized with a String obtained from `Person.getName().toString()`
- `Attendee#getAttendeeName()` -- Returns a String representing the attendee's name

![AttendeeClassDiagram](images/AttendeeClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the add attendee operation works:

![AddAttendeeSequenceDiagram](images/AddAttendeeSequenceDiagram.png)

A `Person` object can be obtained from a `Meeting`'s list of attendees by searching through `UniquePersonList`
for a `Person` with a name matching `attendeeName`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remove attendee feature

User can specify an Attendee to remove from a specified Meeting by specifying its index in the list of Attendees.
This is the main motivation behind using a LinkedHashSet for the implementation of the Attendee Set.

The following sequence diagram shows how the remove attendee operation works:

![RemoveAttendeeSequenceDiagram](images/RemoveAttendeeSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Last Contacted Time feature

Keeping track of the user's last meeting with their contact is facilitated by the addition of a `LastContactedTime` object to `Person`.
Thus, each instance of `Person` will contain an immutable `LastContactedTime` object that stores the user's last meeting with that contact.
The following steps shows how `LastContactedTime` is implemented and utilized in the application.

Step 1. The user inputs the `addc` command into the `CommandBox` input field, with the added field `l/[LAST_CONTACTED_TIME]`.

The following diagram summarizes steps 2 to 6:
<img src="images/LastContactedTime1.png" width="1000" />

Step 2. Entering a correct command with the `Enter` key then calls `execute` on `LogicManager`.

Step 3. `LogicManager` then calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(commandText)` on the `commandText` String, which recognizes that it is an `addc` command.

Step 4. `AddressBookParser` then calls `AddCommandParser#parse()` on the command arguments.

Step 5. `AddCommandParser` then calls `ParserUtil#parseContactTime()` which parses the last contacted time and returns a `LocalDateTime` object called `lastContactedTime`.

Step 6. The `lastContactedTime` object is then passed to the `Person` constructor, which creates a new `Person` that calls the `LastContactedTime` constructor with it.

The following diagram summarizes steps 7 and 8:
<img src="images/LastContactedTime2.png" width="1000" />

Step 7. The completed `Person` is passed to an `AddCommand` constructor which return a new `AddCommand` that can be executed.

Step 8. `LogicManager` then executes the `AddCommand` on the application model.

Step 9. Further execution is carried out, which like before adds the `Person` object to the list of `Person`s in the `Model`, and updates the `Storage` with this new `Person`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark meeting as complete feature

A meeting can be marked as complete using the `mark` command. The command also updates the last contacted time of its attendees to the ending time of the meeting, if the meeting end time is after the attendees current last contacted time.

This is the overall sequence diagram of marking a meeting as complete.

<img src="images/mark/Execute MarkMeetingCommand.png" width=1000/>

When a mark command is entered, it is first parsed by the respective `Parser`s to create a `MarkMeetingCommand` object.

<img src="images/mark/CreateMarkMeetingCommand.png" width=1000 />

When the command is executed, the meeting is marked as complete by creating a new `Meeting` with the same fields except for status, and this meeting is updated to the `Model`.

<img src="images/mark/MarkMeeting.png" width=1000 />

Following this, the last contacted time of all the attendees of the meeting are updated to the end time of the meeting.

<img src="images/mark/Update Attendee LastContactedTime.png" width=1000 />

Finally, a `CommandResult` is produced and returned to the `LogicManager`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Contact Status feature

Each instance of `Person` contains an immutable `Status` object that allows the user to specify which stage of the insurance sales process a contact is at, if applicable.
At the current iteration of OutBook, a status must be one of `NIL`, `Prospective`, `Active`, `Inactive`, `Renewal`, `Claimant` (case-insensitive).
This is tailored according to the responsibilities of an insurance agent, which include:

- Promoting relevant insurance policies to prospective clients
- Keeping active clients updated on their policies
- Finding out why inactive clients did not renew their policies
- Sending renewal reminders to clients whose policies are approaching expiry
- Filing and following up on claims on behalf of their clients

The list of valid statuses is stored as an `Enumeration` object for the following benefits:

- Readability: e.g. `StatusList.NIL` is self-explanatory and easier to understand than something like `StatusList[0]` if an index data structure were to be used.
- Maintainability: If the list of valid statuses changes or expands in the future, it's much easier to update an enumeration. This centralizes the changes in one place, making the code more maintainable compared to scattered string constants.

`Status` is implemented and utilized in a similar manner to `LastContactedTime`, as described [here](#last-contacted-time-feature).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Saving data

- The address book is saved in a JSON file after every command execution. The default path for this file is `/data/outbook.json`, found in the same directly as the application JAR file.

- The JSON file should not be directly edited. Incorrectly editing the file will result in OutBook not being able to load the address book and data will be lost. If directly editing the file is deemed necessary, create a backup before doing so.

- Under normal operation through the application, the JSON file will not become corrupted. If for any reason the file does become corrupted, OutBook will not be able to load the data and will display a blank address book.

  - If data recovery is to be attempted, do not execute any commands. Exit the application. Try to edit the JSON file such that it adheres to the parameters for each field. If data recovery is successful, OutBook will load the address book on boot.

  - If not, the data will be lost. The address book has can only be restored by executing commands through the application.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Planned Enhancements**

### \[Proposed\] Undo and redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />
<br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Feature Flaw\] View Commands

As described in the implementation notes for `viewc` and `viewm` above, the currently displayed `Person` and `Meeting` objects will be cleared when certain commands such as `deletec` and `deletem` are used on a separate object, which is necessary due to the way the view commands are currently implemented. Additional details are in the implementation section referenced above.

We plan to remove the need to handle such edge cases by modifying the way both view commands are implemented. One potential method is as follows:

- Revert the implementation of `viewc` and `viewm` to the original method of storing a copy of the viewed object, rather than the viewed index.
- Modify the behaviour of `editc`, `editm`, `deletec` and `deletem` such that when they are used on the original object currently being viewed, the stored copy will be edited/deleted accordingly.
- This allows the currently viewed `Person` or `Meeting` object to persist regardless of command usage, and only be cleared when the object is deleted, or everything is cleared via the `clear` command.

## **Effort**

### Effort in Model and Storage

Compared to AB3, which only deals with 1 entity type, Person. OutBook deals with 2 entity types and allows significant interaction between them. This means that the model had to be extended and storage had to follow along with it. jackson does not allow storage of pointers, thus it became necessary to work around that using the unique fields on both Person and Meeting.

### Effort in reducing coupling

Compared to AB3, where there were no interaction between entities. OutBook was designed for professionals to manage both their contacts and their meetings, this inherently means that there needs to be interaction between both entities. This interaction increases coupling and decreases cohesion. In order to combat this, many instances of facade, command and observer design patterns were used.

### Effort in implementing many features

OutBook needed to make managing contacts and meetings an efficient process, this meant that there needed to be many quality of life features to make the professional's life easier. Therefore, much effort was dedicated to making data easily retrievable by making almost every field searchable.

### Effort in managing interactions between entities

OutBook required one meeting to interact with many other contacts and for one contact to interact with many other meetings. Because of the interactions between both classes, a change in 1 object must be reflected in everything that references the object while still being immutable. This required thorough testing and analysis to keep track of the interactions and account for them while we were adding more features.
