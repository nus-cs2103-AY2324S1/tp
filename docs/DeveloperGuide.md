### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. Most of these, excluding the `ClockComponent`, `CalendarComponent` and `YearMonthComponent`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* develops a live clock feature to provide users with a convenient visual representation of the current time while efficiently managing employee data.
* produces a calendar function, allowing users to easily observe the daily count of employees on leave.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>DeleteCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Read feature

#### Implementation

The implementation involves the ReadCommand and some associated classes:

* `ReadCommand`â€‰â€”â€‰This class is responsible for executing the `read` command. It parses the user input, retrieves information from the model, and passes the results to the UI for display.

* `ReadCommandParser`â€‰â€”â€‰Responsible for parsing user input and creating a ReadCommand object. It extracts the index of the employee in the last shown list and the requested field.

* `PersonCardWithSpecificField` - Since we have to display only one specific field, we created another person card with just one field. This class is responsible for displaying the name of the person and a specific field requested by the user in the UI. It receives the necessary information from the command result and formats it for display.

Displaying a specific field with the new `PersonCardWithSpecificField` class.

1. Before we execute a command, the `MainWindow` will display a list of person with all their fields as shown below.

![ReadCommandBeforeExecute](images/ReadCommandBeforeExecute.png)

2. After we execute the command, and it is a `ReadCommand`, the `ReadCommand` will set `CommandResult::isRead` to true. The `MainWindow` of UI will then remove all the existing `PersonCard` with a `PersonCardWithSpecificField` as shown below.

![ReadCommandAfterExecute](images/ReadCommandAfterExecute.png)

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the `read` Feature:

![ReadCommandClassDiagram](images/ReadClassDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarises the process of reading specific field for a particular employee:

![ReadCommandActivityDiagram](images/ReadActivityDiagram.png)

This is the sequence diagram to show how the read operation works.

![ReadSequenceDiagram3](images/ReadSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>ReadCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The user enters the command `read 1 /a` and executes it. The command is then parsed by `AddressBookParser`. The `AddressBookParser` parses the input and creates `ReadCommandParser` and `ReadCommandParser` parses the remaining input(exclude the command word). If it parses successfully, it will eventually create a `ReadCommand`. The `ReadCommand` is then executed. If the index is not out of bounds, it will call `Model#setSpecificPersonToDisplay()` to filter the list to only the specific person. Then it will also call the respective getter to get the specific field from the `Person`. After getting the specific field, it will then create a `CommandResult` for the UI to display.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Data Retrieval:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieve only the specific field of the person being read.
  * Pros: Reduces memory usage and may improve performance.
  * Cons: Requires more complex implementation and handling of different data retrieval scenarios.

* **Alternative 2:** Retrieve the entire person's data when executing the "Read" command.
  * Pros: Simple and consistent with other command implementations.
  * Cons: May have performance issues if the person's data is extensive.

**Aspect: Using Index:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use an index to identify the target person for the "Read" command.
  * Pros: Faster and more efficient execution when working with a large number of people.
  * Cons: This may require users to remember or find the index of the person.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the person's name to identify the target person for the "Read" command.
  * Pros: User-friendly, especially when users are more likely to identify persons by name.
  * Cons: This may result in slower execution when many persons exist in the address book.

### Deductions and Benefits

#### Implementation

The deductions and benefits feature comprises 2 sub-features:

1. Add Deduction Feature
2. Add Benefit Feature

#### 1. Add Deduction Feature
The Add Deduction feature is facilitated by `Deduction`, `DeductCommand`, `DeductCommandParser`, `Person`, `PayrollStorage`, `Payroll` and `Salary` classes.

The `Deduction` class is responsible for storing the deduction data for a specific employee.

The `DeductCommand` class is responsible for executing the `deduct` command.

The `DeductCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `deduct` command.

The `Person` class is responsible for updating the list of deductions.

The `PayrollStorage` class is responsible for storing all payroll data for an employee.

The `Payroll` class is responsible for storing the monthly payroll data for an employee, including the starting and ending date of the payroll period.

The `Salary` class is responsible for storing the monthly salary data for an employee.

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the Add Deduction Feature:

![AddDeductionClassDiagram](images/AddDeductionClassDiagram.png)

The user can choose to add a deduction for an employee by entering the index of the employee, or the name of the employee. The `DeductCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `deduct` command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeductCommandParser` class parses the user input:

![ParseDeductionCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ParseDeductCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>DeductCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

When parsing the input, all relevant parameters are extracted according to their respective prefixes, and put into an `ArgumentMultimap`. 
The `value` and `reason` are parsed by `ParserUtil` class first, and a `Deduction` object is created with the parsed `value` and `reason`.
If the parameters are not in the correct format, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

The following sequence diagrams show how the `ParserUtil` class parses the `value` and `reason`:

![ParseDeductionValueSequenceDiagram](images/ParseDeductCommandValueSequenceDiagram.png)

![ParseDeductionReasonSequenceDiagram](images/ParseDeductCommandReasonSequenceDiagram.png)

After fetching the `Deduction` object, `DeductCommandParser` class will then try to parse the `index` first.
The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeductCommandParser` class parses the `index`:

![ParseDeductionIndexSequenceDiagram](images/ParseDeductCommandIndexSequenceDiagram.png)

If the `index` is provided and valid, i.e, is a non-zero unsigned integer, the `DeductCommandParser` class will create a `DeductCommand` object with the `index` and `deduction` object, and return it.
However, if the `index` is not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `ParserUtil` class, and the `DeductCommandParser` class will try to parse the `name` of the employee.
If the `name` parameter is also not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `DeductCommandParser` class. Otherwise, the `DeductCommandParser` class will create a `DeductCommand` object with the `name` and `deduction` object, and return it.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeductCommandParser` class parses the `name`:

![ParseDeductionNameSequenceDiagram](images/ParseDeductCommandNameSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deduct` operation works when the user enters the command `deduct 1 /v 150.00 /r absence`, which means adding a deduction of $150.00 for the employee with index 1, with the reason of `absence`:

![AddDeductionSequenceDiagram](images/AddDeductionSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>DeductCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

After `DeductCommandParser` class parses the user input, the `DeductCommand` class will be called to execute the command. The `DeductCommand` class will then call the `Model` component to obtain the list of employees, and then obtain the `Person` object to add deduction for.

The following sequence diagram shows the referenced process of adding deduction for an employee:

![AddDeductionSequenceDiagram2](images/AddDeductionSequenceDiagram2.png)

1. The `DeductCommand` calls the `getPayrollStorage()` method to obtain the `PayrollStorage` object, which stores all `Payroll` objects in an ArrayList.
2. The `Person` object then calls the `getLatestPayroll()` method to get the `Payroll` object with the latest `startDate` in the ArrayList. 
3. Then it calls the `addDeduction()` method of the `Payroll` object which calls the `addDeduction()` method of the `Salary` object within it. 
4. This creates a new `Deduction` object with the given `value` and `reason`, then store it into the `deductions` field of the `Salary` object, which is an ArrayList of `Deduction` objects.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of adding deduction for an employee:

![AddDeductionActivityDiagram](images/AddDeductionActivityDiagram.png)

#### 2. Add Benefit Feature
The Add Benefit feature is facilitated by `Benefit`, `BenefitCommand`, `BenefitCommandParser`, `Person`, `PayrollStorage`, `Payroll` and `Salary` classes.

The `Benefit` class is responsible for storing the benefit data for a specific employee.

The `BenefitCommand` class is responsible for executing the `benefit` command.

The `BenefitCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `benefit` command.

The `Person` class is responsible for updating the list of benefits.

The `PayrollStorage` class is responsible for storing all payroll data for an employee.

The `Payroll` class is responsible for storing the monthly payroll data for an employee, including the starting and ending date of the payroll period.

The `Salary` class is responsible for storing the monthly salary data for an employee.

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the Add Benefit Feature:

![AddBenefitClassDiagram](images/AddBenefitClassDiagram.png)

The user can choose to add a benefit for an employee by entering the index of the employee, or the name of the employee. The `BenefitCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `benefit` command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `BenefitCommandParser` class parses the user input:

![ParseBenefitCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ParseBenefitCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>BenefitCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

When parsing the input, all relevant parameters are extracted according to their respective prefixes, and put into an `ArgumentMultimap`.
The `value` and `reason` are parsed by `ParserUtil` class first, and a `Benefit` object is created with the parsed `value` and `reason`.
If the parameters are not in the correct format, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

The following sequence diagrams show how the `ParserUtil` class parses the `value` and `reason`:

![ParseBenefitValueSequenceDiagram](images/ParseBenefitCommandValueSequenceDiagram.png)

![ParseBenefitReasonSequenceDiagram](images/ParseBenefitCommandReasonSequenceDiagram.png)

After fetching the `Benefit` object, `BenefitCommandParser` class will then try to parse the `index` first.
The following sequence diagram shows how the `BenefitCommandParser` class parses the `index`:

![ParseBenefitIndexSequenceDiagram](images/ParseBenefitCommandIndexSequenceDiagram.png)

If the `index` is provided and valid, i.e, is a non-zero unsigned integer, the `BenefitCommandParser` class will create a `BenefitCommand` object with the `index` and `benefit` object, and return it.

However, if the `index` is not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `ParserUtil` class, and the `BenefitCommandParser` class will try to parse the `name` of the employee.
If the `name` parameter is also not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `BenefitCommandParser` class. Otherwise, the `BenefitCommandParser` class will create a `BenefitCommand` object with the `name` and `benefit` object, and return it.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `BenefitCommandParser` class parses the `name`:

![ParseBenefitNameSequenceDiagram](images/ParseBenefitCommandNameSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `benefit` operation works when the user enters the command `benefit 1 /v 150.00 /r bonus`, which means adding a benefit of $150.00 for the employee with index 1, with the reason of `bonus`:

![AddBenefitSequenceDiagram2](images/AddBenefitSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>BenefitCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

After `BenefitCommandParser` class parses the user input, the `BenefitCommand` class will be called to execute the command. The `BenefitCommand` class will then call the `Model` component to obtain the list of employees, and then obtain the `Person` object to add benefit for.

The following sequence diagram shows the referenced process of adding benefit for an employee:

![AddBenefitSequenceDiagram3](images/AddBenefitSequenceDiagram2.png)

1. The `BenefitCommand` calls the `getPayrollStorage()` method to obtain the `PayrollStorage` object, which stores all `Payroll` objects in an ArrayList.
2. The `Person` object then calls the `getLatestPayroll()` method to get the `Payroll` object with the latest `startDate` in the ArrayList.
3. Then it calls the `addBenefit()` method of the `Payroll` object which calls the `addBenefit()` method of the `Salary` object within it.
4. This creates a new `Benefit` object with the given `value` and `reason`, then store it into the `benefits` field of the `Salary` object, which is an ArrayList of `Benefit` objects.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of adding benefit for an employee:

![AddBenefitActivityDiagram](images/AddBenefitActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Payroll

#### Implementation

The payroll feature comprises 1 sub-feature:

1. Payroll Calculation Feature

#### 1. Payroll Calculation Feature

The proposed payroll calculation feature is facilitated by 
`Payroll`, `PayrollCommand`, `PayrollCommandParser`, `Person`,
`PayrollStorage`, `Payroll`, `Salary`, `Benefit` and `Deduction` classes.

The `Payroll` class is responsible for storing the monthly payroll data for an employee,
including the starting, ending and payment date of the payroll period. It also includes a `Salary` object.

The `PayrollCommand` is responsible for executing the `payroll` command.

The `PayrollCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input for the `deduct` command.

The `PayrollStorge` class is responsible for storing all payroll data for an employee.

The `Salary` class is responsible for the monthly salary data for an employee, this class includes compulsory
attributes like <u>Basic Salary</u>, a `deduction` and `benefit` class.

The `Benefit` class is responsible for storing the benefit data for a specific employee.

The `Deduction` class is responsible for storing the deduction data for a specific employee

The `Person` class is responsible for holding all the data of a specific employee,
including the `PayrollStorage`.

The following diagram shows the different classes interact with one another 
in the calculate payroll feature:

![PayrollCalculationClassDiagram](images/PayrollCalculationClassDiagram.png)

The user can choose to calculate the payroll for an employee by
entering the index of the employee, or the name of the employee. 
The `PayrollCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the payroll command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the PayrollCommandParser class parses the user input:

![ParsePayrollCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayrollCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

When parsing the input, the input is first passed into ParserUtil#parseIndex method. 
This checks if the input intends to calculate the payroll by using the index of the employee.
If it is by name then a `ParseException` will be caught and all relevant parameters are extracted according to their respective prefixes, and put into an `ArgumentMultimap`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `DeductCommandParser` class parses the `index`:

![ParsePayrollIndexSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayrollCommandIndexSequenceDiagram.png)

If the `index` is provided and valid, i.e, is a non-zero unsigned integer,
the `PayrollCommandParser` class will create a `DeductCommand` object with the `index` and `payroll` object, and return it.
However, if the `index` is not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `ParserUtil` class, and the `PayrollCommandParser` class will try to parse the `name` of the employee.
If the `name` parameter is also not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `PayrollCommandParser` class. 
Otherwise, the `PayrollCommandParser` class will create a `PayrollCommand` object with the `name` and `Payroll` object, and return it.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `PayrollCommandParser` class parses the `name`:

![ParsePayrollNameSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayrollCommandNameSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `payroll` operation works when the user enters
the command `payroll 1`, which means calculating the payroll for the employee with the index 1:

![PayrollCalculationSequenceDiagram](images/PayrollCalculationSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>PayrollCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

After `PayrollCommandParser` class parses the user input, the PayrollCommand class will be called to execute the command. 
The PayrollCommand class will then call the Model component to obtain the list of employees, and then obtain the Person object to calculate payroll for.

The following sequence diagram shows the referenced process of calculating payroll for an employee:

![PayrollCalculationSequenceDiagram2](images/PayrollCalculationSequenceDiagram2.png)

1. The `PayrollCommand` calls the `getLatestPayroll()` method to invoke a method in person object.
2. The Person object then calls the `getLatestPayroll()` method to get the `Payroll` object with the latest startDate in the `PayrollStorage` object.
3. The `PayrollCommand` then calls the `getPayrollString()` method of the `Payroll` object to get payroll description of the person.
4. The `Payroll` object then calls the `getNetSalaryString()` method of the `Salary` object to get the details of the `deductions`, `benefits` and basic salary.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of payroll calculation for an employee:

![PayrollCalculationActivityDiagram](images/PayrollCalculationActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Payslip Generation

#### Implementation

The payslip generation feature is facilitated by `PayslipGenerator`, `PayslipCommand` and `PayslipCommandParser` classes.

The `PayslipGenerator` class is responsible for generating the payslip for a specific employee.

The `PayslipCommand` class is responsible for executing the `payslip` command.

The `PayslipCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `payslip` command.

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the payslip generation feature:

![PayslipClassDiagram](images/PayslipClassDiagram.png)

The user can choose to generate a payslip for an employee by entering the index of the employee, or the name of the employee. The `PayslipCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `payslip` command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `PayslipCommandParser` class parses the user input:

![ParsePayslipCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayslipCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>PayslipCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

When parsing the input, all relevant parameters are extracted according to their respective prefixes, and put into an `ArgumentMultimap`.
If the user provides a date in the form of `dd/mm/yyyy`, the date is parsed by `ParserUtil` class first, and a `LocalDate` object is created with the parsed date.
If the date is not in the correct format, a `ParseException` will be thrown.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ParserUtil` class parses the date:

![ParsePayslipDateSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayslipCommandMonthYearSequenceDiagram.png)

After fetching the `LocalDate` object, if any, `PayslipCommandParser` class will then try to parse the `index` first.
The following sequence diagram shows how the `PayslipCommandParser` class parses the `index`:

![ParsePayslipIndexSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayslipCommandIndexSequenceDiagram.png)

If the `index` is provided and valid, i.e, is a non-zero unsigned integer, the `PayslipCommandParser` class will create a `PayslipCommand` object with the `index` (and `monthYear` date, if any), and return it.

However, if the `index` is not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `ParserUtil` class, and the `PayslipCommandParser` class will try to parse the `name` of the employee.
If the `name` parameter is also not provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown by the `PayslipCommandParser` class. Otherwise, the `PayslipCommandParser` class will create a `PayslipCommand` object with the `name` (and `monthYear` date, if any), and return it.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `PayslipCommandParser` class parses the `name`:

![ParsePayslipNameSequenceDiagram](images/ParsePayslipCommandNameSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `payslip` operation works when the user enters the command `payslip 1 /t 09/10/2023`, which means generating a payslip for the employee with index 1, for the month of October 2020:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>PayslipCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows the referenced process of generating a payslip for an employee:

![PayslipSequenceDiagram2](images/PayslipSequenceDiagram2.png)

1. The `PayslipCommand` calls the `generatePayslip()` method of the `PayslipGenerator` class, which calls the `getFieldMap()` method on itself.
2. The `getFieldMap()` method then calls the `getPayrollWithStartDate()` method on the `Person` object to obtain the `Payroll` object with start date equal to the given one within its `PayrollStorage` object, which stores all `Payroll` objects in an ArrayList. If the user does not specify a `monthYear` date, the `getFieldMap()` method will call the `getLatestPayroll()` method to get the `Payroll` object with the latest `startDate` in the ArrayList.
3. Then it calls various getter methods on the `Payroll` object to obtain the necessary information for the payslip.
4. This `getFieldMap()` method then returns a `HashMap<String, String>` object with the necessary information for the payslip, and the information is written into a PDF file using the `itext7` library.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of generating a payslip for an employee:

### Leave Tracking

#### Implementation

The leave tracking feature comprises 3 sub-features:

1. Add Leave Feature
2. Delete Leave Feature
3. View Leave Feature

#### 1. Add Leave Feature
The Add Leave feature is facilitated by `AnnualLeave`, `AddLeaveCommand`, `AddLeaveCommandParser` and `Person` classes.

The `AnnualLeave` class is responsible for storing the leave data for a specific employee.

The `AddLeaveCommand` class is responsible for executing the `addleave` command.

The `AddLeaveCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `addleave` command.

The `Person` class is responsible for updating the list of leave.

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the Add Leave Feature:

![AddLeaveClassDiagram](images/AddLeaveClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addleave` operation works:

![AddLeaveSequenceDiagram](images/AddLeaveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>AddLeaveCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

After `AddLeaveCommandParser` class parses the user input, the `AddLeaveCommand` class will be called to execute the command. The `AddLeaveCommand` class will then call the `Model` component to obtain the list of employees, and then obtain the Person object to add leave for this employee, and store the leave as an arraylist in `AnnualLeave`.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of adding leave for an employee:

![AddLeaveActivityDiagram](images/AddLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How addleave executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the dates of the leave added.
  * Pros: Easy to trace and track when the leaves are applied, and whether employee is working on specific day.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves only the total number of days of leave added.
  * Pros: will use less memory (e.g. each employee will only need to store an integer for the total number of days of leave per annul)
  * Cons: Not much useful information that can be used (e.g. we do not know the working status of each employee for each day)

#### 2. Delete Leave Feature
The Delete Leave feature is facilitated by `AnnualLeave`, `DeleteLeaveCommand`, `DeleteLeaveCommandParser` and `Person` classes.

The `AnnualLeave` class is responsible for storing the leave data for a specific employee.

The `DeleteLeaveCommand` class is responsible for executing the `deleteleave` command.

The `DeleteLeaveCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `deleteleave` command.

The `Person` class is responsible for updating the list of leave.

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the Delete Leave Feature:

![DeleteLeaveClassDiagram](images/DeleteLeaveClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deleteleave` operation works:

![DeleteLeaveSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteLeaveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>DeleteLeaveCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

After `DeleteLeaveCommandParser` class parses the user input, the `DeleteLeaveCommand` class will be called to execute the command. The `DeleteLeaveCommand` class will then call the `Model` component to to obtain the list of employees, and then obtain the Person object to delete the leave from this employee, and update the arraylist of leave in `AnnualLeave`.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of adding leave for an employee:

![DeleteLeaveActivityDiagram](images/DeleteLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How deleteleave executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes the dates of the leave only if all of them exist in the employee's list of leave.
    * Pros: Ensures that the leave are always deleted correctly and easy to maintain.
    * Cons: May cause inconvenience to users as they will have to know the exact dates to delete.

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes all the matching dates of leave as long as they exist in employee's list of leave, ignoring those that do not exist.
    * Pros: Users are able to delete the leave within the range of dates that they entered, provided that they exist.
    * Cons: Can be confusing to users as to what have been deleted, and also harder to maintain.

#### 3. View Leave Feature
The View Leave feature is facilitated by `ViewLeaveCommandParser`and `ViewLeaveCommand`

The `ViewLeaveCommand` class is responsible for executing the `viewleave` command.

The `ViewLeaveCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input for the `viewleave` command.

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the View Leave Feature:

![ViewLeaveClassDiagram](images/ViewLeaveClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the `viewleave` operation works:

![ViewLeaveSequenceDiagram](images/ViewLeaveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>ViewLeaveCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

After parsing user input, the `ViewLeaveCommandParser` creates a `ViewLeaveCommand` and executes it. This command then interacts with the `Model` to fetch the list of employees. Subsequently, it generates a hashmap where each local date corresponds to a list of employees on leave. By querying this hashmap for the specified date, the command identifies employees on leave. Finally, it creates a `CommandResult` containing the names of employees on leave for the given date.

The following activity diagram summarises the process of viewing leave for an employee:

![ViewLeaveActivityDiagram](images/ViewLeaveActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How viewleave executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** View the employee who is on leave on the specific date
    * Pros: User gets to know which specific employee is on leave on that date
    * Cons: Scanning through a list of names could be less efficient

* **Alternative 2:** View the number of employee who is on leave on the specific date
    * Pros: Simpler implementation, providing a quick count of employees on leave.
    * Cons: Users only obtain the number of employees on leave without individual details.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Attendance 

#### Implementation

The attendance marking feature comprises 2 sub-features:
1. Mark attendance feature
2. Attendance Report feature

These two features are dependent on the following classes:
* AttendanceStorage
* Attendance
* AttendanceType

Below are the relationships between these classes:

![Attendance package classes](images/AttendanceStorageClassDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The <code>markXYZ()</code> method above is a placeholder for the different methods: <code>markPresent()</code>, <code>markAbsent()</code>, and <code>markLate()</code>.
</div>

Each `Person` class references a single `AttendanceStorage` object, which contains the `storage` -- an `ArrayList<>` of `Attendance` objects associated with the given employee.

The AttendanceType is an enumeration with the values `PRESENT`, `ABSENT`, `LATE`, `ON_LEAVE`. Each `Attendance` object references an `AttendanceType` and a date, such that an `Attendance` object consists of the day the attendance was recorded as well as the type of attendance that was recorded.

The `AttendanceStorage` only stores `Attendances` that are late or absent. Dates that are not in the storage are assumed to be marked as present for that given employee.


#### 1. Mark attendance feature

The `mark` mechanism is dependent on the `Attendance` class. The Attendance class contains information on the date and `AttendanceType` of a `Person`.  It implements the following operations:
* `Attendance#markAbsent(LocalDate date)` -- marks the attendance of the employee on the provided date as absent.
* `Attendance#markLate(LocalDate date)` -- marks the attendance of the employee on the provided date as late.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `mark 1 /at LATE` command to mark the 1st employee in the list as late.

Step 2. The `mark` command calls `MarkCommand#markByIndex()` of the given employee, which calls the `Attendance#markAbsent()` of the given `Person` class associated with that employee.

This working status is then updated in the GUI as shown below:

![GUI before mark command](images/GUIBeforeMarkCommand.png) ![GUI after mark command](images/GUIAfterMarkCommand.png)

The sequence diagram for the example above is as shown below:

![Mark Sequence Diagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>MarkCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the `mark` feature:
![Mark Command Class Diagram](images/MarkCommandClassDiagram.png)

#### 2. Attendance Report feature

The attendance reporting mechanism is dependent on the `AttendanceStorage` class. The `AttendanceStorage` is a collection of the `Attendance` objects associated with an employee. It implements the following operations:
* `AttendanceStorage#getCount` -- counts the number of days the attendance of type `attendanceType` appears in the `AttendanceStorage`
* `AttendanceStorage#getAttendanceReport` -- provides an `int[]` of the number of days of each attendance type in the following order: [leave, absent, late]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `attendance 1` command to retrieve the attendance of the first employee.

Step 2. The `attendance` command calls `AttendanceCommand#reportByIndex()` of the given employee, which calls the `AttendanceStorage#getAttendanceReport()` of the given `Person` class associated with that employee.

Sequence diagram is as shown below:
![Mark Sequence Diagram](images/AttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for <code>AttendanceCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


The following class diagram shows how the different classes interact with one another in the `attendance` feature:
![Attendance Command Class Diagram](images/AttendanceCommandClassDiagram.png)

Finally, the following activity diagram shows how a user would use both the `mark` command and `attendance` command to take the attendance of her employees:
![Attendance Activity Diagram](images/AttendanceActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How AttendanceStorage is assigned to each Person**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** As an attribute of a Person.
  * Pros: Easy to query for a Person's attendance status
  * Cons: May be sub-par performance as it would store identical Attendance objects for each Person.
    * (Person A could be absent on 24th Oct, Person B could also absent on 24th Oct, but the current software architecture design does not allow shared usage of the duplicates)
* **Alternative 2:** As a UniqueAttendanceList.
  * Pros: No copies of Attendance objects having the same attribute values
  * Cons: Difficult to reference a Person to each Attendance.

* **HR manager**: Human Resource Manager in the company
* **Employee**: A staff in the company 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Planned enhancement**

### Stricter rules for adding employees with an identical name

1. Currently, the `add` command allows users to add an employee with the same name as an existing one, but in different cases (e.g. John Tan and john tan), and with other fields identical. However, the two employees should be considered the same as they have the same identity, and the command should be modified. To resolve this, we plan to implement a case-insensitive comparison of the names of the employees.

2. This can be done by modifying the `equals()` method in the [`Person`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java) class to ignore the case of the name, i.e. changing `name.equals(other.name)` to `name.toLowerCase().equals(other.name.toLowerCase())`.

### Enhancing UI Dimensions for Optimal Alignment 

1. Our current UI exhibits alignment issues, such as message wrapping to the next line as shown below, and we aim to ensure optimal alignment.
   ![Wrapped text in UI](images/Wrapped.png)

2. To resolve this, we plan to modify the minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth, and maxHeight parameters of the respective boxes for a more refined and cohesive appearance.

### Streamlining Calendar Navigation for User Convenience

1. Currently, users need to input commands to switch between months in the UI calendar.

2. In our future plans, we intend to implement a user-friendly dropdown menu along with dedicated next and previous buttons, providing a more intuitive interface for toggling between months.

### Enhancing Deletion Functionality for User Convenience

1. Currently, the `delete` command allows the deletion of employee via index and name. However, for the deletion via name, if there are multiple employees with the same name, i.e., Amy Tan, Amy Teo and Amy Lee, even if you enter the command `delete /n Amy Lee`, which is the full name of one of these employee, it will return a list of these employees with the name "Amy" rather than directly deleting the employee that matches the full name.
   
2.  While this is to allow greater flexibility in searching, in our future implementation, we would allow the deletion of employee using the full name to provide more convenience to the users.

### Expanding Leave Tracking Capabilities for Enhanced User Flexibility

1. The current leave tracking system only allows users to track the data for annual leave.
   
2. To better cater to the users of ManaGease, we will implement the ability to track leave for other types of leave like sick leave, parental leave, compassionate leave, etc.

### Enhanced Access Control for Leave Deletion

1. Currently, the `deleteleave` command does not allow users to delete leave from employee if the date of leave to delete is already over. This is to reduce the likelihood of any unintended or intended change in leave data. However, to offer users greater flexibility in editing the leave data, we will implement some form of access control to allow certain users to have the ability to delete leave data for dates that are already over.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### JavaFX Clock and Calendar Component

1. Challenges faced :
	- `Component Selection`: AB3 initially uses VBox and HBox for layout, but midway through development, we realized that a GridPane offered a more effective solution, leading to a shift in our approach.
	- `Synchronization`: Ensuring seamless synchronization with the local date and displaying the number of employees on leave
	- `Command-Based Month Navigation`: Implementing a command-based system for toggling month changes introduced challenges in managing signals to accurately control the month navigation functionality.

2. Effort required:
	- `Iterative Development`: The need for constant adjustments to the layout and functionality, especially during the transition from VBox and HBox to GridPane, required iterative development and continuous refinement.
	- `Restarting for Alignment Checks`: Verifying alignment in the JavaFX calendar component demanded frequent restarts, leading to considerable time investment in the development process.
	- `CSS File Interpretation`: Reading through and comprehending the extensive CSS file became a significant effort, as it was crucial for styling and maintaining the visual integrity of the JavaFX calendar component.
	- `Command-Based Navigation`: Developing and refining the command-based month navigation system required careful consideration of signal management and user interface responsiveness.

3. Achievements:
	- `Effective Layout with GridPane`: Despite the initial challenges, adopting GridPane significantly improved the layout efficiency of our calendar component, ensuring a visually appealing and well-organized interface.
	- `Successful Synchronization`: Overcoming synchronization complexities, we successfully implemented a calendar component that accurately reflects the local date and dynamically displays the number of employees on leave.

### Generation of PDF Payslips

1. Challenges faced:
   - `Printing information onto a PDF template`: The crux of this feature is to collect different deductions, benefits, and payment dates of an employee's payroll, and print them onto a PDF template. As such, we decided to use the `itext7` library to print information onto the template.
   - `Reading template file`: The template file is a PDF file, and we had to find a way to read the file and obtain the fields in the template. Since we are releasing ManaGease as a single JAR file, we are not supposed to require our users to download the template file from somewhere else.

2. Effort required:
   - `Understanding itext7 APIs`: We then spent some time learning how to use the `itext7` library to print information onto a PDF template, by reading the Developer's Documentation and JavaDoc.
   - `Maintaining a map between fields and contents`: Since the library only acts as a PDF reader and writer, we must manually obtain all fields (blank spaces) in the template and fill them with the appropriate information. To do so, we created a `HashMap<String, String>` to map the fields to their respective contents. This map is then passed to the `itext7` library to print the information onto the template.
   - `Reading template file`: We have tried many methods to read the template file, e.g., reading it as a `File` object, or an `InputStream` object. However, the file could not be read when using the JAR file to test.

3. Achievements:
   - `Reading template file`: We managed to read the template file by using the `PaySlipGenerator.class.getClassLoader().getResource("template.pdf").toString()`, which returns a `String`. The `String` is then passed into the `PdfReader` object. This method allows us to read the template file from the JAR file.
   - `Printing information onto a PDF template`: We managed to print information onto a PDF template using the `itext7` library, and the `payslip` command works as intended.
