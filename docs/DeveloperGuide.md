### 2.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### 2.1.1 Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

#### 2.1.2 How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 2.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### 2.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](./images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `WellNusParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `WellNusParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `WellNusParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 2.4 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### 2.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `WellNusStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 2.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. WellNus Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features of WellNus are implemented.

### 3.1 Cancelling an Appointment

The canceling of an appointment is facilitated by the `CancelCommand`. It extends `Command` and allows the user to cancel an appointment at a specified index.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("cancel 1")` as an example.

![Interactions inside the Logic component for "cancel 1" command](images/CancelSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How an Appointment should be canceled**

* **Current Choice:** Create a new `CancelCommand` class which handles the cancellation of an appointment.
    * Pros: User input will be shorter and easier to read.
    * Cons: More work to implement.

* **Alternative 1:** Add appointment cancellation functionality to the existing `DeleteCommand`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: User will have to type longer commands since appointment details can be lengthy, which may lead to more complex commands.

### 3.2 View Feature

This feature is facilitated by the use of the ViewCommand class which extends the Command interface.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.
![Interactions between LogicManager and ModelManager for a view command](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ViewCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

View Command handles both the viewing of all students and all appointments. The workflow is shown below:
![ViewCommand Control Flow](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There should be a diamond connecting the 4 separate branches
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the 4 branches leads to the "end" individually .
</div>

### 3.3 Student Notes feature

The adding of student notes is facilitated by `NoteCommand`. It extends `Command` and allows the addition of a `Note`
to the student at the index specified by the user.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, 
taking `execute("note 1 note/Likes dogs.")` as an example.

![Interactions inside the Logic component for "note 1 note/Likes dogs." command](images/NoteSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How a `Note` should be added to a `Student`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `NoteCommand` class which handles the addition of a note 
to a `Student`.
    * Pros: User input will be shorter in length and easier to read
    * Cons: More work to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Add `Note` as a field in the `AddCommand`
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: User will have to type much longer commands, since `Note` can be up to 200 characters long,
  leads to very lengthy commands
      
### 3.4 \[Proposed\] Check clashing appointments feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed check clashing appointments mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueAppointmentList`. It implements the `Iterable`
interface that stores an `ObservableList` of type `Appointment`.

The following methods are implemented to facilitate the check clashing appointments process:

* `UniqueAppointmentList#hasOverlap(Appointment appt1, Appointment appt2)` —  Checks if two appointments have overlapping time.
* `UniqueAppointmentList#hasOverlappingAppointments(Appointment newAppt)` —  Compares the new appointment to schedule with every other appointment currently in `UniqueAppointmentList`.


The following sequence diagram shows how the class operates when an appointment is added:

![ClashSequenceDiagram](images/ClashSequenceDiagram.png)


When the user schedules a new command, the `UniqueAppointmentList` runs its `hasOverlappingAppointments()` method to check if the
new appointment clashes with any existing appointments. It raises a `OverlappingAppointmentsException` if the method returns true,
and prevents the user from scheduling that appointment.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user schedules an apppointment:

![ClashActivityDiagram](images/ClashActivityDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** There should be a diamond connecting the 3 separate branches
but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the 3 branches leads to the "end" individually .

### 5.4 Non-Functional Requirements
1.  Cross-Platform Compatibility:
    - Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Scalability and Performance:
    - Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
    - Should support efficient data retrieval and manipulation for the specified contact volume.
3.  Usability and Efficiency:
    - A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should 
    be able to perform the majority of tasks more quickly using _CLI_ commands compared to using a mouse on the _GUI_.
    - The _CLI_ interface should prioritise efficiency by providing clear and concise commands, minimising unnecessary prompts,
    and offering time-saving shortcuts.
4. Updates and Maintenance:
    - Updates should not disrupt the user's workflow or data.

*{More to be added}*

### 5.5 Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface. Usually the in-built terminal or in the IDE the application is run on.
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface.
* **Risk Level**: Students can be classified as high, medium, or low-risk level determined by the counsellor.
