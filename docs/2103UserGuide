***Taking charge of your PROject Management!***

Seamlessly integrate contact, client, and project management, simplifying access to coding-related contacts,
facilitating collaboration, and offering command-line efficiency for project managers.

CodeContact is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CodeContact can get your contact
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. **CodeContact** aims to put the **P.R.O** in project management  by enabling project managers to be:
1. **Productive**
2. **Reliable**
3. **Organised**

Here’s an overview of how CodeContact can help you streamline your project management processes.
* Store and edit information about developers and clients related to projects
* Store and manage projects and their deadlines
* Assign projects to developers and clients

If you are familiar with CodeContact, jump to our [**Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents) to find out what you are looking
for!

If you are new here, you may start with learning [**How to navigate this guide**](#navigating-this-guide) and visit

### Parameter Information

Within the tables below, you can find out more about the parameters that CodeContact supports. These parameters come in
handy when crafting commands in CodeContact.

Here are some notes about these parameters.

* Each parameter comes with **constraints**. These constraints detail the specific formats of text that
  each parameter accepts as valid user input.
    * Not following these constraints will **result in an error** when entering the command.
    * Nonetheless, CodeContact will not stop working. Rather, a message will be provided to you on
      how to correct your command.

| Command Box                      | Allows users to enter CodeContact commands.                                                                                                                                                                |

| Tabs                             | Allows users to see different lists of information on clicking on the relevant tabs. The tabs will also automatically switch to the correct tab corresponding to the command executed.                     |
| Developers/Clients/Projects card | Displays a list of Developer, Client or Project Cards. This list can be manipulated through commands like `find` and `list`.                                                                               |
| Deadlines progress               | Displays the progress of deadlines for a certain project.                                                                                                                                                  |

| Re-sort                          | Click on the respective words, there will be a small black arrow that appears. You can press to resort the data eg. show date from furthest to nearest day.                                                |

### Notes on GUI
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
If you executed a `find` command in developer tab and switched to the client tab, when you return to the developer tab the find results will be cleared and
the whole list of developers will be shown again. This is the intended behavior of CodeContact as we hope that this can save you the time
from always needing to call the list command.

# **Known issues**

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **When tampering with the storage files**, if you tamper with the storage files leading to incorrect format, the application will not be able to
   read the data and will throw an error. The remedy is to delete the `addressbook.json` file created by the application before
   running the application again.
