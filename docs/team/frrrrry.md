### Project: NUSearch

NUSearch is a desktop application used for consolidating NUS professors, teaching assistants (TAs) and studentsâ€™ profiles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, it has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

##### Favourite Feature 
* What it does: Allows a user to favourite a person.
* Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of persons which profiles they want to view on a more often basis.

##### Unfavourite Feature
* What it does: Allows a user to unfavourite a person. 
* Justification: This feature allows the user to remove a person from their favourite list.
