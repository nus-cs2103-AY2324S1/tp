### Project: Tutor Connect

This is an address book made for tuition centre managers to easily track, schedule, and notify tutors of their upcoming schedule, optimised for users who prefer a CLI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=dishenggg&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * **New feature**: Added the ability to add schedules. (Pull requests [#71](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/71), [#72](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/72), [#91](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/91))
      * What it does: allows the user to add a schedule to the address book. A schedule contains a tutor that it is 
        assigned to as well as a start and end time.
      * Highlights: This enhancement was challenging as it required in-depth analysis of design alternatives and involved
        additions to many parts of AB3 that were performed by multiple members at the same time.
    * **New feature**: Added schedules view into the Ui. (Pull request [#102](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/102))
    * **New feature**: Added sorting of schedules by start time. (Pull request [#143](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/143))
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now easily locate a desired 
        schedule by looking for its start time.
      * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as we decided to sort the schedules in two halves. The first half
        being schedules that are from today and later in ascending order. The second half being schedules from before 
        today in descending order.
    * **New feature**: Added a separator dividing past and present/future schedules. (Pull request [#177](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/177))
      * Justification: This feature improves the product by allow the users to quickly identify past and present/future
        schedules.
    * **New feature**: Added a current time to the Ui. (Pull request [#211](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/211))
        * Justification: As the main feature of the app is scheduling, having the current time will make it easier for the user.
