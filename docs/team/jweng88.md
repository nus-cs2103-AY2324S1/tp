### Project: Tutor Connect

This is an **address book made for tuition centre managers** to easily track, schedule, 
and notify tutors of their upcoming schedule, optimised for users who prefer a CLI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: 
  * [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jweng88&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **New feature:** Added the ability to mark schedules. 
  (Pull request [#144](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/144))
    * What it does: Allows the user to mark a specified schedule as `MISSED` or `COMPLETED`.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to create and set the status of a specified
    schedule.
    * Highlights: Implementing this feature posed some challenges as it required the addition of the status field in 
    the schedule object, in order to set the status of a specified schedule, and implementing tests to ensure that the
    valid schedule is marked with a valid status. 
  * **New feature:** Added the ability to view both tutor list and schedule list in one panel. 
  (Pull request [#212](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/212))
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the tutor list and schedule list side by side within the main panel.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to easily refer to the tutor list or 
    schedule list when inputting commands like `edit-t` or `edit-s` that requires referring to the index in the list.
    This greatly enhances the user experience, providing greater convenience for the users.
    * Highlights: Implementing this feature necessitated modifications to the `MainWindow.fxml` and the creation of a 
    new `ListsPanel` to store both `PersonListPanel` and `ScheduleListPanel` so that they can be displayed together in 
    the `MainWindow`.
  * **Refactored feature:** Refactored the `ListCommand` to `ListTutorCommand`. 
  (Pull request [#86](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/86))
    * What it does: Updates the existing list command with the context of the application, tutors.
    * Justification: With the addition of schedules, it is necessary to contextualise the `ListTutorCommand` to 
    only display the list of tutors so that the implementation is separated from the schedule list.
  * **Refactored feature:** Refactored the `DeleteCommand` to `DeleteTutorCommand`.
    (Pull request [#87](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/87))
    * What it does: Updates the existing delete command with the context of the application, tutors.
    * Justification: Same as the `ListTutorCommand` above, with the addition of schedules, it is necessary to 
    contextualise the `DeleteTutorCommand` to only delete from the list of tutors, so that the implementation is
    separated from the schedule list.
