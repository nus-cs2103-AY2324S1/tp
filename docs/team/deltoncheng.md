### Project: BandConnect+

BandConnect++ is a desktop application that helps music producers seeking talented musicians to manage their musician contacts and form a band of their preferences. 
It is optimised for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add Band [\(#79)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/79)
  * What it does: Creates a Band entity and adds it to the address book
  * Justification: This new feature is essential as we need to create a band so that we are able to group musicians together under a band.
  * Highlights: This feature requires creating a new entity, which is challenging since it required an in-depth understanding on the whole logic of the address book.
  This feature also requires to add other essential classes such as UniqueBandList.
  * Credits: This feature took inspiration from the original add person command since it follows the same logic.

* **New Feature**: Add Musician To Band [\(#87)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/87)
  * What it does: Adds a Musician entity into a Band entity
  * Justification: This new feature is essential as we would like to be able to group musicians together under a band.
  * Highlights: This feature requires adding a musician entity to a band entity and ensuring that the address book gets updated with every addition.
  This feature was also built from scratch and requires the integration of the Musician list and Band list.
