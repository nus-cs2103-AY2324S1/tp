### Project: BandConnect+

BandConnect++ is a desktop application that helps music producers seeking talented musicians to manage their musician contacts and form a band of their preferences. It is optimised for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=shuyangk&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)


* **New Feature**: Edit Band Information [\#135](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/135).
  * What it does: Allows users to edit information about a specific band, namely the name and genres of the band.
  * Justification: It is important to be able to edit information that may be outdated in order to update it when changes occur.
  * Highlights: This enhancement involved changing the structure of the Band class and the Commands associated with it to improve functionality.
  * Credits: *I took inspiration from the existing edit command of AB3 and edited it to suit the context of the Band class*
