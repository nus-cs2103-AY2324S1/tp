### Project EzContact

EzContact is a desktop app made for insurance agents to manage customer details,
optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EzContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.


Given below are my contributions to the project.
