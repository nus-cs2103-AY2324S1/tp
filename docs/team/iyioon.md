### Project: CheckMate

CheckMate is designed to streamline the process of room bookings for hotel employees. With an emphasis on efficient room-booking matching using the Gale-Shapley algorithm, it offers real-time room search, service scheduling, and amenity management. Optimized for administrative roles, it ensures that room allocation and guest needs are seamlessly addressed.

* **New Feature**:  Added autocomplete functionality to the command input field. (Pull request [#114](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/pull/145))
  * What it does: Allows the user to quickly complete commands by pressing the TAB key. It provides suggestions based on the prefixes of commands, enhancing the user's efficiency.
  * Justification: This feature greatly enhances user experience. Users no longer need to type in full commands, which not only saves time but also reduces the chance of typos or command errors. Moreover, users are given an example parameter along with prefix completion.
  * Highlights: Implementing this feature required an understanding of both the UI components and the logic behind command parsing. It involved integrating the PrefixCompletion class with the CommandBox UI component and handling key events effectively. Moreover, I ensured that the prefix suggestions were in the correct order and spaced appropriately for optimal usability.
