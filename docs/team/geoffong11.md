### Project: Connexion

Connexion is a desktop application for undergraduate students to manage their networking connections.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Added `schedule` command
    * User can add schedule and schedule name to their contacts
    * An important feature as it helps the user to record down when is their next meeting with specific contacts
    * Considerations have to be made as schedule is not initialized upon creation of contact
  * Added two new fields, Company and Job
    * Contacts now have a `Company` and `Job` field.
    * An important feature as it helps the user to remember what company and job their contacts are in
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=geoffong11&breakdown=true)
