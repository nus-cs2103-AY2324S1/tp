### Project: TASsistant
TAssistant is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**:
  * Searching of people
  - What it does: Allows the user to search for people based on their name, module or tutorial groups
  - Justification: Allows the user to look for specific people, or list out all users in a module or tutorial group respectively.
  - Highlights: Implementation of the function had to be completed in stages, as the Tutorial and Modules were not fully implemented when search was first implemented. Tutorial and module were refactored as well which necessitated search to be refactored.
