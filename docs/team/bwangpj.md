## Overview

**ConText** is a desktop app that allows for managing contacts quickly via text commands, with useful features relevant to NUS SoC students.
While it has a Graphical User Interface, most of its user interactions happen via an in-app Command Line Interface.

## Summary of contributions

### Code contributed

[TP RepoSense Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=bwangpj&breakdown=true)

### Enhancements implemented

1. Filter command to allow users to filter contacts by Tag, and associated tests
2. Store command history and allow navigating between previous commands using up/down arrow keys, similar to an actual CLI, and associated tests
