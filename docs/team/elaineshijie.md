### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. Faster access and store of students’ contacts and data, provides better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete tasks in the task list of lesson.
  * What it does: allows the user to add task with a description to a lesson in the schedule.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of the tasks to complete in preparation for tuition lessons.
  * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as a lesson has to be shown before deleting any tasks and task list can only be changed through a lesson which adds complexity to the code.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the abilty to indicate subjects taught to each student.
  * What it does: allows the user to add subjects that they are tutoring for each student.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as users can track which subjects they are teaching each student.
  * Highlights: The implementation was tedious as it required changes to add and edit commands of student.
