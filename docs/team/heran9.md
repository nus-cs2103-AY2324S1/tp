### Project: TuitionConnect

TuitionConnect is a **desktop app for simplifying the process of administration and finance management for private tutors, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, you can maximise tracking tutee-specific details, teaching-schedule management, and finance management.
