### Project: TuitionConnect

to be added soon

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to calculate total monthly revenue.
    * What it does: allows the user to a monthly revenue figure.
    * Justification: This feature allows private tutors to financially plan better.
    * Highlights: This feature accounts for different number of days in a month for caluclation of revenue. (e.g. There are 5 Wednesdays in Nov 2023 but only 4 in Oct 2023 which will result in different number of lessons and total revenue)
  
* **New Feature**: Added a `ScheduleListPanel` to see a summarised view of upcoming lessons.
   *  What it does: allows the user to quickly see a list of lesson cards that is sorted sequentially from the current day.
   *  Justification: This feature allows private tutors to easily plan for their schedules.
   *  Highlights: This features requires an enhancement of lesson comparator to sort the lesson cards.
