### Project: TuitionConnect
TuitionConnect is a **desktop app** built for tutors and tutoring businesses to simplify the process of
administration and finance management, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to calculate total monthly revenue. (Pull requests
