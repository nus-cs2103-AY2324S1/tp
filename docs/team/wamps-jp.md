### Project: Jobby

Jobby is a desktop app for tracking job applications. It saves job contacts and applications in an addressbook, which the user can view with a GUI, and interact wtih using a CLI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Sort command
    * What it does: Allows users to sort contacts and job applications.
    * Justification: For reference quality of life, since a job applicant can have many applications and contacts. Makes it easier to view relevant data.
    * Highlights: Created necessary logic for data to be sorted.

* **New Feature**: Remind command
  * What it does: Allows users to get a reminder of upcoming or future deadlines.
  * Justification: Since deadlines can be hard to keep track of, this helps simplify it. Urgent or future deadlines can be viewed easily.
