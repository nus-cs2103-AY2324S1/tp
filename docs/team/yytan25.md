### Project: BandConnect++
BandConnect++ is a desktop application that helps music producers seeking talented musicians to manage their musician contacts and form a band of their preferences.
It is optimised for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature 1: Delete a band** [\#89](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/89)
  * What it does: Allows users to delete a band using the index of the band.
  * Justification: It is a common use case for music producers to remove bands that are disbanded or otherwise no longer needed.
  * Highlights: This enhancement involves updating the `FilteredBandList` to remove the band that is deleted.
  In addition, the GUI will update the band list to reflect the removal of the band.
  * Credits: I took inspiration from the `DeleteCommand` of the original AB3 and applied the same logic to the `FilteredBandList`.


* **New Feature 2: Remove a musician from a band** [\#93](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/93), [\#130](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/130)
  * What it does: Allows users to remove a musician from a band using the indices of the musician and the band.
  * Justification: It is a common use case for music producers to manage their bands and delete musicians who are no longer present.
  * Highlights: This enhancement involves a new operation in the `UniqueBandList` to access the target `Band` and `Musician` objects,
  and then removing the musician from the band. A new method, `updateFilteredBandMusicianList`, was also implemented to reflect the
  updated band members in the GUI.
  * Credits: I took reference from the implementation of `AddMusicianFromBandCommand` and applied the logic in reverse for this feature.
