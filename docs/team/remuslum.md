### Project: HR Insight

HR Insight is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Birthday Command.
    * What it does: Allows the user to view all employees' birthdays in a given month/months.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can plan birthday celebrations ahead of time and prevent the issue of neglecting an employee's birthday, which could affect morale of the employees.
    * Highlights: This feature is challenging since parsing checks are required to see if the months provided are valid or not. Furthermore, if no month is provided, all birthdays in the present month are shown.
    * PR: [#78] https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/pull/78
