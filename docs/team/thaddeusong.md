Project: [Ba]king [Br]ead

## Overview

[Ba]king [Br]ead is a desktop inventory and recipe book management application that allows users to add ingredients and view
recipes. The user interacts with it through a CLI. The GUI is implemented using JavaFX and the project is written in Java.

### Enhancements implemented

- **Feature**: Adding Recipes
  - Allows the user to add their own recipes to the recipe book component
  * Justification: This feature is necessary for the recipe book.
  * This feature was the most complex command to implement since it requires several lines of input from the user, as well as disabling other commands whilst a recipe is being added.
  
- **Feature**: Unit compatibility
  - Allows the user to add ingredients of a different unit to the existing stock, and combine the quantities correctly
  * Justification: This feature makes adding ingredients to stock much smoother, since users do not need to do unit conversions by themselves, rather the application does it for them.

- **Enhancement** Designed model of the app
