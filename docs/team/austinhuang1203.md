### Project: Staffsnap

### Overview
Staffsnap is an application for HR managers seeking to hire job candidates. By providing multiple useful features, it makes the tracking and hiring process much easier.

### Summary of contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

● **New Feature**: Confirmation command

○ What it does: This command will ask the user to confirm their choice before clearing the app's data.

○ Justification: This feature prevents the HR person from accidentally deleting everything which will have drastic consequences.

○ Highlights: This enhancement was tricky to implement as it required the current state of the parser and the previous command inputed.

○ Credits: Myself

● **New Feature**: Duplicate handling

○ What it does: Duplicate interviews are handled by using a numerical identifier

○ Justification: There might be multiple interviews of the same type like technical, hence having automatic handling makes things easier.

○ Highlights: This feature can be extended and reused to handle duplicates for other fields.

○ Credits: Myself
