### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for Financial Advisors (FA) to manage client’s contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The app also includes features
such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `FinancialPlan` field and wrote tests
    * Justification: As a financial advisor, it would be convenient to have a person's current financial plans available for business purposes.
    * (Pull request [#69](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/69))

* **New Feature**: Added appointment sidebar that shows upcoming appointments of clients in chronological order and wrote tests
    * Justification: Financial advisors may want to view all upcoming appointments easily in chronological order so that it is easier for them to plan their timetables.
    * Highlights: This enhancement creates another UI element to show various other appointment-specific details in the future. It requires an understanding of ObservableList interface and the way the list is being tracked by JavaFX.
