### Project: BandConnect++
BandConnect++ helps musicians manage contact with other musicians to easily form a band of their preference. It is optimised for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature: List band members [\#107](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/107), [\#109](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/109)**
  * **What it does:** it allows the user to view the band members information
  * **Justification:** it is a common use case for music producers to check who are the existing band members for a band
  * **Highlights:** this enhancement involves major modifications to the GUI, since we must ensure the musician panel are consistent to whatever the band panel is showing. Many UI modifications are done to other relevant features to enhance the consistency and intuitiveness for users.
  * **Credits:** My teammate did the initial implementation of this feature which supports listing band members by index of the band. I tweaked it so that now it takes in a band name as input since it is more likely for producers to remember the band name instead of band index. I have also done extensive testing to ensure the feature work properly and does not affect other operations.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Enhanced GUI to include an extra band panel [\#84](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/84)
  * Modified `ModelManager` and relevant commands so as to synchronize musician and band panels and make UI more intuitive for users.
  * Update test utility classes to include new entity `Band`
  * Enforced constraints on phone and email to ensure integrity of data regardless of operations executed (`add`, `delete`, `edit` etc.) [\#151](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/151) [\#192](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/192)
  * Wrote unit test of `findb` command [\#109](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/109)
  * Enhanced unit tests of `add` and `edit` commands [\#193](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/193)
