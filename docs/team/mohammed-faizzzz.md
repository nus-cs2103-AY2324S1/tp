### Project: MediLink Contacts

MediLink Contacts aims to help medical staff including nurses/doctors navigate through patient details in
their high workload and time-pressured working environment. When medical emergencies arise, it becomes crucial to
provide rapid access to emergency contacts for patients and access other details of the patients to make decisions more
quickly. It is optimised for CLI so that users can quickly access the information. There is also a GUI created with
JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
