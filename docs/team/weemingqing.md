### Project: ManaGease

ManaGease is a comprehensive contact management application designed for HR managers to streamline and consolidate critical information for your full-time employees. It provides convenient access to essential data, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, bank account details, salaries, join dates, and annual leave records. With this information at your fingertips, the application simplifies annual leave tracking and automates payroll generation. By doing so, it minimizes errors, boosts operational efficiency, and leads to significant time and cost savings. This results in improved organizational structure and a more seamless workflow, benefiting your business in various ways.


Given below are my contributions to the project.
<br>

* **New Feature**: Added an addleave command to allow users to add leave to an employee.
  * What it does: Allows user to add in leave for an employee.
  * Justification: This feature plays an important role within the application, as leave management stands as a cornerstone of HR administration. It empowers users to seamlessly monitor employees' vacation days so as to ensure that employees do not take extra leaves off, ensures daily work status oversight, and greatly simplifies the payroll calculation process.
  * Highlights: Introduced methods that enables the storage of leave dates as strings and their retrieval from storage, offering enhanced data management capabilities.

<br>

* **New Feature**: Added an deleteleave command to allow users to delete leave from an employee.
    * What it does: Allows user to delete leave from an employee.
    * Justification: This feature plays an important role within the application, as mentioned above in the justification section for the Add Leave feature. It allows users the flexibility to edit leave data by deleting them and adding new ones.

<br>

* **New Enhancement**: Added the ability to delete employee via name.
    * What it does: Allows user to delete employees by using their names.
    * Justification: This feature plays a pivotal role in the application's efficiency, particularly as your employee list expands. It provides a swift and effective means to filter employees by their names and allows direct deletion if the name is unique in the list.
    * Highlights: This feature seamlessly merges filtering and deletion functions, making it especially useful when there are multiple employees with the same name. It streamlines the process of singling out the desired employee for deletion.

<br>

* **New Enhancement**: Added a colored label to display the working status of an employee on the current day.
  * What it does: Allows user to see the working status of an employee; whether they are late, absent, on leave or present.
  * Justification: By employing colors to represent the work status of employees, this feature provides a quick visual reference for users to assess individual employee performance and efficiently plan workforce management.
