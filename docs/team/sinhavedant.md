### Project: ModuLight

ModuLight is a lightweight application for educators to manage and
perform statistical analysis on the educational records of students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**:

  * Here is my [Code Contributed](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=sinhavedant&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * I mainly worked on the Storage component. Our project stores the data in 3 json files namely `studentBook.
    json`, `gradedComponentBook.json` and `scoreBook.json`. I wrote code for `studentBook.json` and 
    `gradedComponentBook.json`.
  * I also edited parts of `scoreBook.json` related code.
  * The code follows similar style as the AB3 but writing it for multiple storage files required proper 
    understanding of the AB3 Storage code. 
  * I implemented complete testing for code related to `studentBook.json` and partial testing for code related to 
    other storage classes.

* **Contributions to the UG**:
  * Added How to use the guide section.
  * Added Quick Start Guide.
  * Added Saving the data and Loading the previous data section.

* **Contributions to the DG**:
  * Updated the Storage Component
  * Added 3 puml files all inside Storage Component
  * Added Instructions for manual testing for Saving and Loading Data.

* **Review contributions**:
  * Reviewed multiple PRs.
  * There was one instance where I realised a PR had commits with wrong formatting so I requested the teammate to 
    edit the commit name before merging the PR.
