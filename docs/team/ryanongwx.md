### Project Medbook

**Overview**: MedBook is a desktop application crafted specifically for doctors and medical administrative assistants of private clinics. It offers an intuitive and efficient interface for seamless management of patient details and medical records, enabling healthcare professionals to easily monitor and access patient information.

- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ryanongwx&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Enhancement 1**: Search Patient v1.2

  - Broaden the scope of search such that it covers all the necessary information stored within all patients. This is to ensure that a doctor could search for any information on a patient when required. This is especially important in situations where doctors would like to search for all patients which have a certain condition or have a certain allergy.

- **New Feature 1**: Add Attach File Functionality v1.3

  - Allows doctors to attach a medical report documennt to a record. This allows efficient management of medical documents and allows doctors to keep track of their records in an organised manner.
  - Files would be stored in their local storage of the device. Upon attaching the file, they would be able to open the document whenever they require it.
  - This is extremely useful for attaching files such as blood test results that is vital to be kept together with patient records.

- **New Feature 2**: Add Encryption/Decryption Functionality v1.3

  - Encrypts data from the application using AES encryption such that the data in the addressbook.json file is encrypted.
  - This is to ensure privacy and confidentiality for patient data.
  - This functionality was later scrapped due to the group prject constraints

- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed all Bugs in repo for v1.2

  - [Link to Bug Fix](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/40)
  - Prior to this all Java CI checks failed due to failing of testcases and some features not implemented correctly
  - Fixed wrong feature implementations wrote by teammates in addrecord, addpatient and pin patient commands.
  - Fixed all testcases such that all Java CI checks could pass in in addrecord, addpatient and pin patient commands.

- **Project management**:

  - Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub
  - Filmed and stitched the video demo together
  - Assessed testers' issues from PE-D

- **Documentation**:

  - User Guide:
    - Added documentation for the all features that I had implemented
  - Developer Guide:
    - Added implementation details for the all features that I had implemented
