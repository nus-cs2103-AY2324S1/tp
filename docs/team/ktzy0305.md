### Project: EventWise

EventWise is a event management desktop application used for managing contacts and details specific to an event. It combines the flexibility of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Designed for event planners, EventWise helps you to easily track and access crucial information in a single place, simplifying event coordination and communication. It is written in Java and has about 16 kLoc.

### My Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * What it does: Allows the user to remove an existing vendor from an event that they are part of.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to remove a vendor from an event in the event they were added by mistake or have to be removed from the event due to unforseen circumstances.

* **User Interface**: Dynamic Data ListView Component (`Event`, `Person`, `Vendor`, `Venue`) on the same list. [\#92](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-F13-3/tp/pull/92)
  * What it does: Implemented a Dynamic Data ListView component to support the simultaneous display of various object types such as `Event`, `Person`, `Vendor`, and `Venue` in a single list

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * UI enhancement to clear event details shown when executing the `deleteEvent` command. [\#79](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-F13-3/tp/pull/79)
    * Wrote additional test cases to increase coverage from 74.52% to XX.XX%. []()

* **Team-based tasks**:
    * Created labels and tags in team repository.
    * Reviewed Pull Requests done by the team and check for correctness of the code.
    * Bug Fixes:
