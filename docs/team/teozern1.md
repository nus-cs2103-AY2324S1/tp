Given below are my contributions to the project.
- **New Feature: Adding of assignments**
  - What it does: allows the user to add assignments to the system
  - Justification: allows the user to organize the assignments which need to be marked and graded
  - Highlights: GUI had to be altered to show assignments on one side and people on the other
  - Credits: Used the same model as person and existing person list panel for GUI.
