### Project: Connectify

Connectify's codebase, while short, is robust, made with extra care and deliberate design. We focus on creating easy-to-develop yet high quality product for both the users and the developers.

Listed below are my contributions to the project:

* **Code contribution**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=totalCommits&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=dickongwd&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
