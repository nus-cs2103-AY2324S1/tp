### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for Financial Advisors (FA) to manage clientâ€™s contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The app also includes features
such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort list by appointment time, and name by lexicographical order. [\#73](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/73) [\#90](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/90)
    * What it does: Allows the user to perform sorting of list by appointment time and lexicographical order of name.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can more efficiently find clients by name and the proximity of their appointments to view upcoming appointments.
    * Credits: The feature was implemented by referencing JavaFX ObservableList documentation.

* **New Feature**: Added confirm override window for `schedule` command if person already has a current appointment. [\#123](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/123)
  * What it does: Caution a user if he intends to schedule a new appointment when there is already one that is not yet complete.
  * Justification: Most people only arrange one appointment at a time. So the design prevents multiple appointments and also serves as a reminder of a previously set appointment.
  * Highlights: This feature causes the logic flow of the method to change if there is currently an appointment and results in breaking the execution into 2, getting a response from the user before deciding whether to continue the execution of the program.
  * Credits: The feature was implemented by referencing the help function from AB3. However, the main logic of the function was done by myself.
