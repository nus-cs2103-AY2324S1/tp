### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for **Financial Advisors (FA)** to manage clientâ€™s contacts, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. The app also includes features such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.
