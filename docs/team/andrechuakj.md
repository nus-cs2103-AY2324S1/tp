### Project: CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS

#### Overview

CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS is a one-stop application for CCA Heads to manage CCA members and events, optimised for CCA Heads who prefer to use command line interface.
My team and I adapted the product from an existing Java application called [Address Book (Level 3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) over a span of 1.5 months.

Given below is a summary of my contributions to the project. All of my code contributions can be found in this [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=andrechuakj&breakdown=true#/)
