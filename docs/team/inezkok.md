### Project: HouR

HouR is a desktop HR management application used for managing and organising personnel data.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Reset Feature `reset`
    * What it does: Allows users to reset fields (overtime hours and number of leaves taken) for all employees by resetting them to their default value of o (0 overtime hours and an empty LeaveList).
    * Justification: This allows HR managers to efficiently reset overtime hours and number of leaves taken of every employee in just one command, as opposed to have to manually resetting them for each employee one by one.

* **New Feature**: EditLeave Feature `editleave`
  * What it does: Allows users to edit existing leave dates.
  * Justification: This allows HR managers to correct their previous mistakes in keying in leave dates (e.g. from a typo).

* **New Feature**: AddRemark Feature `addremark`
  * What it does: Allows users to add remarks to employees.
  * Justification: This allows HR managers to add and keep track of remarks made by supervisors for different employees, which can be used later to assess employee's performance.
  * Highlights: Originally, we wanted to add in a date field to keep track of when the remark was added. However, when trying it caused a lot of trouble due to the saving and loading of remarks into the json file.

* **New Feature**: DeleteRemark Feature `deleteremark`
  * What it does: Allows users to delete remarks from employees.
  * Justification: This allows HR managers to delete outdated or incorrect remarks made by supervisors for different employees, which ensures that the remarks kept are an accurate representation of each employee.
