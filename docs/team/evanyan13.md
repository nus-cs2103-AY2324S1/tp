# Project: JobFindr

This portfolio provides an overview of my contributions to JobFindr.

## Overview

JobFindr is a desktop-based job application management application.

The inspiration for JobFindr came from the shared challenge faced by all members of our team - the daunting task of
organising and keeping track of the numerous job applications we submit. Recognising that this is a common experience
among NUS students, we felt a strong urge to develop a software solution that would make this process more manageable
for students like us.

JobFindr was born out of this necessity, offering a one-stop solution for recording and managing your job applications
effortlessly.

## Implementation Contribution

1. Programmed the implementation the `Deadline` field
    * **What it does**: Implemented the `deadline` field in the job application using the `LocalDateTime` parser,
      enhancing
      flexibility in date and time format entry.
    * **Justification**: Users might be unfamiliar with the constraints of Java's `LocalDateTime` format, potentially
      leading to difficulties in entering the deadline field.
    * **Highlights**: We had to format the input deadline before initializing the `Deadline`instance. A key
      consideration
      was maintaining the abstraction of this implementation within the `ParserUtil` class.

2. Revamped the User Interface Design for JobFindr
    * **What It Does**: This update involves a comprehensive redesign of the visual elements of each JavaFX component in
      JobFindr, alongside a reformatting and addition of new components to the application's window.
    * **Justification**: Being a CLI-based desktop application, our aim is to develop a user-friendly GUI for our users.
    * **Highlights**: This task was particularly challenging due to the steep learning curve associated with JavaFX and
      FXML. It required a complete overhaul of the CSS styling and reorganization of each component's styleClass.
      <br>
3. Improved Real-Time GUI Responsiveness in JobFindr by enhancing the MVC Architecture
    * **What It Does**: Implemented immediate GUI updates in response to user commands, eliminating the need for manual
      refresh.
    * **Justification**: Critical for user interface efficiency, this feature provides instant feedback on command
      execution.
    * **Highlights**: This marked my initial foray into applying the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
