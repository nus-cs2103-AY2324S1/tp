### Project: KeepInTouch

KeepInTouch is a desktop app for managing contacts for job-seekers. It can also help job-seekers to manage events for career purposes.

* **New Feature**: Delete and add tags to existing contacts ([\#63](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/63))
  * What it does: It allows users to add/delete one or more tags from any existing contacts with one simple command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the original product can only change the tags when adding a new contact. Changing tags will require deleting a contact and add it again with the new tags which is a huge inconvenience.

* **Existing Feature**: Adapt the `storage` in our architecture. ([\#32](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/pull/32))
  * What it does: It allows `storage` to work with newly added feature such as `note` and `event`.
  * Justification: Without this adaptation, our product will not be able to store and retrieve data correctly.
