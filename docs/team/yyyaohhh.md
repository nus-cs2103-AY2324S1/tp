## Project ModCraft

ModCraft is a desktop application built for students from National University of Singapore (NUS) to help them **track and organise their academic journey**. With ModCraft serving as your **personal study planner**, you can easily:

* Keep track of the courses you have taken
* Plan ahead to fulfill graduation requirements
* Continuously adjust your study plan to new changes

And much more!

ModCraft streamlines the stressful process of course planning by providing a seamless user experience. It is tailored for efficiency through a Command Line Interface (CLI), complemented by the convenience of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=yyyaohhh&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

- **Project management**:

  - Involved in managing releases on GitHub.

- **Enhanced and new features**:

  - `delete` command: allows users to delete a module from the module plan only if it exists.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in adding modules and ModCraft should provide a way for them to rectify them.
  - `calculateCAP` command: allows users to calculate the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) of all valid modules in the module plan easily, using their grades and modular credits.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because calculating and knowing the CAP is very important to NUS students, as it is used in many areas.<br>
    e.g. Calculating CAP for Semester Exchange Programs (SEP) and application for scholarships.

  - `calculateMC` command: allows users to calculate the total sum of Modular Credits (MCs) of all modules in the module plan, regardless of their grades.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because calculating and knowing the MCs is very important to NUS students, as it is used in many areas.<br>
        e.g. Calculating MCs for Semester Exchange Programs (SEP) and checking for graduate requirements.
