### Project: Connectify

Connectify is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Connectify can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to show reminders on dashboard [\#85](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/85)[\#121](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/121)
  * What it does: Creates Reminders automatically based on a Person's Lead as well as his last interaction.
  * Justification: This feature creates a system to informs the user of the next action he should take for a particular person as well as when.
  * Highlights: The approach to updating reminders was intertwined with the existing commands and logic of the project.
  * Credits: *{The look of the reminders list is inspired by a senior team (https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/)}*
