# Timothy Putra Prasetio's Project Portfolio Page

### Project: LetsGetHired

_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in
efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and
efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy
the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship
tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New feature**
    * Added the `Deadline` field. (
      see [#80](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/80))
        * _What it does_: Allows users to specify the internship application
          deadline or any other crucial dates.
        * _Justification_: It is important for users to know the deadline of
          their internship applications.
        * _Highlights_: The `Deadline` field is a new field that was not present
          in the original project.

* **Enhancements to existing feature**
    * Updated the `Deadline` and `Status` field to be optional. (
      see [#83](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/83))
        * _What it does_: Allows users to add a new internship application
          faster (without all the fields).
        * _Justification_: Some internship applications may not have a deadline
          or status (yet).
        * _Highlights_: The `Deadline` and `Status` field are now optional
          fields. If not specified, they will take the default value
          of `No Deadline` and `Pending` respectively.

* **Project management**
    * In overall project management, I contributed in the following areas:
        1. **Meeting Organization**:
           I initiated and led weekly team meetings, ensuring effective
           communication and alignment of project goals. By utilizing tools like
           Zoom and Google Docs, I fostered a collaborative environment that
           encouraged team engagement and brainstorming.
        1. **Deadline Management and Tracking**:
           I was responsible for tracking project deadlines, employing tools
           like GitHub issues for task management. I also ensured that the team
           was on track to meet the project milestones and deadlines.
        1. **Innovation and Feature Enhancement**:
           I actively proposed new features and improvements, such as ideas on
           how the UI should look like. My suggestions were always grounded to
           the pain points of our application's target audience, demonstrating a
           commitment to continual improvement.
        1. **GitHub Repository Management**:
           I efficiently managed issue tracking, pull requests, and version
           control. This role was crucial in maintaining code quality and
           ensuring that all team members' contributions were effectively
           integrated into the project.

* **Testing**
    * In terms of testing, I contributed in the following ways
        1. **Updating Test Data**:
           Recognizing the importance of relevant test data, I took the
           initiative to update all sample data sets. This involved tailoring
           the data to closely match real-world scenarios applicable to our
           application, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of our
           testing processes. (
           see [#115](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/115))
        1. **Comprehensive Feature Testing**:
           With each new feature developed, I ensured that comprehensive testing
           was conducted. This included reviewing test cases that covered a wide
           range of scenarios, from typical usage to edge cases. My approach
           ensured that each feature was robust and performed as intended in
           diverse situations. (
           see [#108](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/108) by
           Aprup Kale)

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide (see
      our [User Guide](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w17-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html))
        1. **User-Focused Redesign of the User Guide**:
           I undertook a comprehensive overhaul of the existing UG, transforming
           it into a more user-centric document. This involved reorganizing
           content, simplifying technical jargon, and ensuring that the guide
           was accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
        2. **Inclusion of Annotated UI Images**:
           To enhance clarity and ease of use, I included annotated images of
           the application's user interface (UI) in the guide. These visual aids
           were instrumental in helping users understand the functionality and
           navigation of the application more intuitively.
        3. **Utilization of MarkBind Components**:
           By incorporating MarkBind components, such as boxes and tabs, I
           improved the presentation and retention of information in the guide.
           These elements made the UG more interactive and engaging,
           facilitating a better learning experience for the users.
        4. **Enhanced Introduction and Getting Started Section**:
           I crafted an inviting and informative introduction and getting
           started section, ensuring that new users could quickly familiarize
           themselves with the application. This section set the tone for the
           rest of the guide, providing a clear and concise overview of what to
           expect.
        5. **Continuous Updates and Improvements**:
           Throughout the project lifecycle, I diligently updated each section
           of the UG to reflect the latest features and changes in the
           application. This ensured that the documentation remained accurate
           and relevant at all times.

           included a step-by-step guide on how the command processes input,
           interacts with other components, and produces the desired outcome.
