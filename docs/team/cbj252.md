### Project: TASsistant

TASsistant is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features, which I made and are primarily responsible for**:
    * Added the ability to add and remove people to modules through addToModule and removeFromModule.
    * Added the tutorial model, modelling a tutorial in a module, through addTutorial and deleteTutorial.
    * Added field in GUI that shows the tutorials and modules that a person has.
    * Added field in GUI that shows the modules and tutorials that the user is a TA of.

* **Enhancements to features, which I assisted in but are not primarily responsible for**:
  * Wrote the parser and some code for the commands addToTutorial and removeFromTutorial, which add or remove users from tutorials.
