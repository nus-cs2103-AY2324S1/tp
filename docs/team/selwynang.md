## Project: CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS

### Overview

CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS is a one-stop application for CCA Heads to manage CCA members and events, optimised for CCA Heads who prefer to use command line interface.
My team and I adapted the product from an existing Java application called [Address Book (Level 3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) over a span of 1.5 months.

Given below is a summary of my contributions to the project. All of my code contributions can be found in this [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=selwynang&breakdown=true#/).

### Features Implemented
* **Delete Member Feature** [#104](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/104)
  * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander to delete a member from CCACommander's database.
  * **Justifications:** Gives the user the power to delete any irrelevant members from the database once they are not needed anymore.
* **Delete Event Feature** [#104](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/104)
  * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander to delete an event from CCACommander's database.
  * **Justifications:** Gives the user the power to delete any irrelevant events from the database once they are not needed anymore.
* **Find Member Feature** [#146](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/146)
  * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander to find a member from CCACommander's database by using the member's name.
  * **Justifications:** Speeds up the process where the user can determine if a particular member is in the database, especially if the member list has many members.
* **Find Event Feature** [#146](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/146)
  * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander to find an event from CCACommander's database by using the event's name.
  * **Justifications:** Speeds up the process where the user can determine if a particular event is in the database, especially if the event list has many events.
* **Unenrol Feature** [#179](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/179)
    * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander to unenrol a member from an event which the member was enrolled to.
    * **Justifications:** Provides the user with the flexibility to remove the association between a member and event if they are no longer related to one another, which parallels what happens
  in real life when a member is no longer part of an event for the CCA.
* **Undo Command** [#154](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/154)
    * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander undo previous commands that he/she has entered, which has changed the data within CCACommander.
    * **Justifications:** Greatly increases the efficiency of the user's workflow as he/she can quickly revert commands which has affected data within CCACommander.
    * **Credits:** Implementation is inspired by [Address Book (Level 4)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4).
* **Redo Command** [#154](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/154)
  * **Feature details:** Allows the user of CCACommander to redo a command that he/she has undone previously.
  * **Justifications:** Greatly increases the efficiency of the user's workflow as he/she can quickly redo commands that he/she has accidentally undone.
  * **Credits:** Implementation is inspired by [Address Book (Level 4)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4).

Relevant tests were added for these commands.

### Project Management
* As the Team Lead, I managed task deadlines. I set internal deadlines and buffers to ensure that tasks can be completed on-time. I did so by setting up 
and managing milestones on [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/milestones).
* Opened and assigned [issues](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/issues/created_by/selwynang) to every group member and ensured they are updated on what to do.
* Released Releases [v1.3](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3) and [v1.3.1](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.1) on GitHub.
