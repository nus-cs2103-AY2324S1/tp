### Project: LetsGetHired

_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in
efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and
efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy
the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship
tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New feature**: Added the command `SortCommand` and its
  parser `SortCommandParser` [#89](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/89)
    * _What it does_: Enabled users to organise internship applications by 
      various fields
    * _Justification_: Addresses a Medium Priority User Story - 
      providing users with a more organised view of their internship
      applications.
    * _Highlights_: Implemented a `InternApplicationComparator` class with 
      singleton comparators.

* **Enhancements to existing feature**: 
  * Add `Cycle`
    field [#46](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/46)
    * _What it does_: Facilitated users in specifying the cycle of their 
       internship applications.
  * Update `find` command [#56](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/56)
    * _What it does_: Updated `find` command to allow for partial matching of 
      the `Company` field.
    * _Justification_: Provides a better user experience for internship application
      search
