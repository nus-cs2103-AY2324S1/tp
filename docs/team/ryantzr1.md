### Project: Connectify

Connectify is a networking platform designed to help professionals efficiently manage their connections and enhance their networking experiences.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `addCompany` Command [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/51)
* Implemented the `addCompany` command, enabling users to add company to their Connectify.
* This feature allows users to track the information of their company contacts, which is crucial in network management.
* Significance: Elevates Connectify's utility by streamlining professional network management with seamless company contact tracking.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `find`, `companies` and `people` Command [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/98)
* Developed the `find` command, allowing users to search for entities in Connectify based on the person name or company name.
* This feature also comes with `findCompany` and `findPerson` Commands where you can find company and people specific information.
* Update: `find` command is now deprecated as we feel that `companies` and `people` function allow users to find companies and people more efficiently.
* Significance: Enhances Connectify's user experience by enabling efficient search and retrieval of both individual and company-specific information, boosting productivity and information accessibility.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `deletePerson` Command [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/75)
* Implemented the `deletePerson` command, enabling users to delete a contact from a given company.
* This feature allows users to remove a person from a company's contact list.
* Significance: Provides users with a streamlined method to de-clutter and manage their contact lists within specific companies, optimizing organisation and enhancing user control.
