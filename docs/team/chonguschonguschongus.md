### Project: MediLink Contacts

MediLink Contacts aims to help medical staff including nurses/doctors/pharmacists navigate through patient details in
their high workload and time-pressured working environment. When medical emergencies arise, it becomes crucial to
provide rapid access to emergency contacts for patients and access other details of the patients to make decisions more
quickly. It is optimised for CLI so that users can quickly access the information. There is also a GUI created with
JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Enhanced the Find feature to function with NRIC, gender as well as name.
    * What it does: Allows users to search for Patients/Doctors by their NRIC and gender or simply name
    * Justification: Users can search by a specific attribute, increasing convenience

* **New Feature**: Added a Find Appointment function to locate a specific appointment by NRIC of people involved
* **New Feature** Added a Delete Appointment function to delete a specific appointment by index
* **New Feature** Added display of list of Appointments made in the Ui
