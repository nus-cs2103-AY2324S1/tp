### Project: lesSON

lesSON is a desktop flashcard application for Computing students in University who struggle with
memorisation and consolidation of knowledge. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Card Display [\#72](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/72)
  * What it does: Hide the answer from the card class from user view
  * Justification: Prevents users from seeing the flashcard answers from the start
  * Highlights: Answer field is in the card but not shown on the Ui

* **New Feature**: HelpCommand [\#130](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/130)
  * What it does: Pops up a window to show the user guide to be used for new users
  * Justification: Ease of access to a user guide link
  * Highlights: New window pop up that allows for automatic copying of link

* **New Feature**: ClearCommand [\#130](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/130)
  * What it does: Removes all cards in the deck, giving users an empty deck [\#124](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/124)
  * Justification: For advance users to clear the deck and add own cards
  * Highlights: Ability to wipe lesSON with a clear command to allow ease of reset

* **New Feature**: SolveCount Ui and Storage [\#128](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/128)
  * What it does: SolveCount can now be displayed in display card and Ui, stored locally as well
  * Justification: Storing solve count in json file will allow ease of reference and statistics tracker
  * Highlights: Solve counts keeps track of number of times a card is solved in history

* **New Feature**: Export [\#133](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/133)
  * What it does: Showcases the current deck of cards and allows users to copy them and send to their peers.
  * Justification: Allows one to share the generated cards with their peers
  * Highlights: Separate window pops up for export

* **New Feature**: Import [\#133](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/133)
  * What it does: Allows users to input the text that they have received from their peers
  * Justification: Users will need to import the cards their peers shared with them in a fixed format
  * Highlights: Separate window pops up for import, will close the app after importing for best Ui experience
