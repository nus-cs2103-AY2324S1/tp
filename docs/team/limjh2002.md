## Project: CareCentral

CareCentral is an app designed specifically for healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and hospital staffs between 25-60 years old.
It is focused on helping healthcare professionals to manage their patients' information and appointments. While it has a GUI,
it is designed to be used via a Command Line Interface (CLI) for users who prefer typing.
