### Project: Jobby

Jobby is a desktop address book and job application tracking tool. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created in JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Apply command
    * What it does: Allows users to add job applications.
    * Justification: For job application tracking, since one person can apply to multiple positions within a company, a separate class is required for job applications.
    * Highlights: Created necessary classes for storing information related to job applications.

* **New Feature**: UI for showing job applications
    * What it does: Allows users to view their job applications.
    * Justification: To let them see what job applications they have added.

* **New Feature**: Storage of job applications
    * What it does: Stores information on job applications in JSON file.
    * Justification: For users to save their job applications.
    * Highlights: Decided to store the job applications instead the organization JSON to ensure that the job application is truly associated to it.

* **New Feature**: Editing of job applications
    * What it does: Allows users to edit job applications.
    * Justification: In case their job application status changes or they made a mistake while adding the job application.

* **New Feature**: Deleting of job applications
    * What it does: Allows users to delete job applications.
    * Justification: Allows users to delete old job applications.
