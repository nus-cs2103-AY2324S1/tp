### Summary of Contributions

- **Code Contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=angkyakdifp&breakdown=true)
- **Enhancements implemented:**
    - Added a new 'view' command
      - What it does: Allows the user to view the specified patient or specialist details in the larger panel
      - Justification: This feature enhances user experience by providing a detailed and focused view of patient 
      or specialist information. By displaying specific details in a larger panel, users can quickly assess relevant 
      information without navigating through multiple screens or sections.
      - Highlights: Various bugs can happen in a lot of cases, such as deleting a person does not make the panel change.
    - Modifying UI
      - What it does: Modifies the user interface by transforming the single panel row card into a dual-panel layout.
      - Justification: This enhancement significantly improves the user experience and workflow efficiency. 
      By adopting a dual-panel layout, the UI enables users to perform searches and access detailed information 
      in a seamless manner. 
      - Highlights: Modifying the code often leads to margin and font errors, creating inconsistencies in the 
      layout and visual elements.Passing arguments to the FXML panel also create a lot of mistake. Incorrectly 
      passed arguments can lead to unexpected behavior, making it challenging to identify and resolve issues in 
      the code logic.
