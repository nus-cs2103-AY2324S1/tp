### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. It allows faster access and storage of students’ contacts and data, providing better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only. The app will only provide simple student analytics (without detailed student progress analysis).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=HollaG&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* New feature: Schedule & Lessons [#78](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/78)
  * What it does: Allows users to add lessons to the app.
  * Justification: Lessons are the core feature of the app, allowing users to keep track of when their lessons are.
  * Highlights: Laid the groundwork for all future lesson-based implementation

* New feature: Saving and restoring of lessons [#97](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/97)
  * What it does: Allows users to save lessons so that lesson data is not lost.

* New feature: Task List in lesson (Collaboration) [#124](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/124)
  * What it does: Tasks lists allow users to remember what tasks they have to do for each lesson. My part involved the correct saving and parsing of task lists.
  * Justification: As part of our app's goal to be an all-in-one solution, tasks are important to expand on the management ability.
