### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. It allows faster access and storage of studentsâ€™ contacts and data, providing better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=HollaG&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
