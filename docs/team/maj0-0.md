## Enhancements implemented
* **New Feature**: Tasks Command
    * What it does: Lists out the set of tasks for each group.
    * Highlights: Since StudentConnect is catered towards CS2103T and CS2101, the tasks are pre-set and are automatically assigned to each group.
    * Challenges: Our team had initially planned to have a separate UI list for tasks, but due to time constraints, the tasks now show up in the feedback panel instead.
* **Enhancement**: Added Tutorial, Gender and Nationality fields
    * Included the tutorial, nationality and gender fields to the person model.
* **Enhancement**: Updated UI for nationality and gender fields.
* **Enhancement**: List Command
