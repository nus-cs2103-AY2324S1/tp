### Project: iVolunteer

iVolunteer is an application for volunteer coordinators to manage volunteers, events, and their interactions. The user interacts with it using a CLI, with a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java with about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a display pane for `Event` within the JavaFX GUI ([#86](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/86)).
  * Description: The `Event` display pane is displayed alongside the `Volunteer` display pane.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing volunteer coordinators to track both volunteers and events at the same time, allowing for interactions within events and volunteers to be performed.
  * Highlights: This feature allowed for the creation of features that manage event-volunteer interactions, like the [`eaddv` command](../UserGuide.md#adding-a-volunteer-into-an-event-eaddv) and [`eremovev` command](../UserGuide.md#removing-a-volunteer-from-an-event-eremovev). Although the implementation of the `Event` pane itself was easy since I was able to reference the `Person` display pane in the project we based iVolunteer on, placing the `Event` pane side-by-side with the `Volunteer` pane was a bit more difficult due to the addition of new containers to accommodate the new `Event` display pane.

* **New Feature**: Implemented an end date field in the `Event` model. I realised that most events require a *start date* and *end date* while our initial plans had only 1 date for event. After approval from the group, I worked on the implementation of an *end date* field for events ([#98](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/98)), proving the merits of our project using an **agile design approach**.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to track the quantities of *roles* and *materials* in an event, which involves the addition of a new command, the [`eaddm` command](../UserGuide.md#adding-and-tracking-quantity-of-materials-into-an-event-eaddm).
  * What it does: allows the user to track the amount of roles or materials present in the event.
  * Justification: This feature allows volunteer coordinators to track the amount of materials and roles that have already been added to the event.
  * Highlights: Due to this feature augmenting the `Event` model as well as event-volunteer interactions, implementation of this feature was relatively complex and it took a few days for me to finish the material tracking feature ([#109](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/109)). Since the role tracking feature was similar but did not require implementing a new feature, it did not take me as long to implement this feature ([#128](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/128)).

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for users to set the maximum number of volunteers within an event ([#132](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/pull/132)).
  * Justification: This feature is a quality-of-life feature for volunteer coordinators who may have a capacity to the number of volunteers they are able to have for an event. This feature allows volunteer coordinators to know when they have exceeded the volunteer capacity and re-assign volunteers appropriately.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this feature was not very complicated as it was overall not as complex of a feature compared to role and material tracking, with not many sources of bugs to take care of. However, it did involve adding a new parameter `vs/` to the `ecreate` and `eedit` commands which required some refactoring and code changes.
