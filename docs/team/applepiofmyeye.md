### Project: ManaGease

ManaGease is a desktop Human Resource (HR) management system used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark employees absent, late or present.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark any of the employees in the database as absent, late or present for the current day. 
  * Justification: This feature is crucial to the effectiveness of the application because it sets the status of an employee to be late or absent, but is also the factor which other commands such as payroll calculation could make use of in future implementations as well.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects future commands to be added. It required a designing of a new type of storage and storage methods, and hence analysing which design choices would be optimal was done. The implementation and integration with other aspects of the code was also challenging.

* **New Feature**: Added an attendance command to allow the user to view the full attendance report of an employee.
  * Justification: This feature is an aspect of employee performance that we currently measure. This feature allows for future implementations of signalling which employees have been away for long periods and need to be caught up, or which employees always seem to be coming late.
