### Project: CheckMate

CheckMate is designed to streamline the process of room bookings for hotel employees. With a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the necessary information needed at a glance, and the application
being optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), we have combined elegance and efficiency when it comes to
the process of room booking for hotel receptionists.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added remarks (Pull request [#164](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/pull/164))
    * What it does: Allows the user to add remarks to the individual bookings.
    * Justification: Expands the booking system's capabilities, allowing for the inclusion of additional, important information which could be specific guest requests or internal notes.
    * Highlights: This involved familiarising myself with every aspect of the Command implementation, from the user input to the UI update.

* **Code contributed**: [Reposense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=RB9823&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22)
