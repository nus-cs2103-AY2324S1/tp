### Project: HouR

HouR is a desktop HR management application used for managing and organising personnel data. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add Leave Feature `addleave`
  * What it does: Allows the user to add a leave period to a specified employee.
  * Justification: Leave tracking is an important component of employee management systems. With this feature, HR managers will be able to keep track of the leaves taken by respective employees.
  * Highlights: Deciding whether it would be better to add a single date each time or a specified period. 
    Ultimately, the team decided that it would be best to implement the command flexibly, with the current format allowing the addition of both a single leave date and a leave period with multiple days.


* **New Feature**: List Leave Feature `listleave`
  * What it does: Allows the user to view the list of employees on leave on a particular day.
  * Justification: Provide the user a fast and easy method to view the employees that are on leave on a particular day, rather than checking through each and every employee one by one to see if they are on leave on the date of interest.
  * Highlights: Initially, this feature was only meant to check which employees were currently on leave (in real time). However, I realised that it would be more useful if the user could check leaves taken on specified days, to help with the employee management process.
