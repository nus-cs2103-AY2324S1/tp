### Overview

UNOFAS is a desktop app for Financial Advisors (FA) to manage clientâ€™s contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The app also includes features
such as sorting, scheduling and other commands to query information quickly required by the FA.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=sopa301&breakdown=true)


* **Enhancements Implemented**:
  * Added `next-of-kin` and `next-of-kin phone` fields and wrote tests.
    * Justification: As a financial advisor, it would be convenient to have a person's next-of-kin details available for
    business purposes.
    * Pull request [#43](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/43)
  * Added confirm clear window for `clear` command.
    * Justification: `clear` is a very powerful command that can delete the entirety of a user's work in an instant. To
    safeguard against mistakes, we decided to add an extra confirmation requirement to ensure that the user actually wants
    to wipe the contact book.
    * Highlights: This feature causes the logic flow of the method to change if the clear command is about to be executed, getting a response from the user before deciding whether to continue the execution of the program.
    * Pull request [#75](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/75)
  * Added available keywords for `help` command.
    * Pull request [#67](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/67)
  * Enhanced `find` command to accept multiple names, tags and financial plans and wrote tests.
    * Justification: Users may want to search by other fields, not just name. Also, searching across categories have
    niche uses and can be easily supported.
    * Pull request [#125](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-1/tp/pull/125)
