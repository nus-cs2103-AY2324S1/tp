### Project: ModCraft

ModCraft is an app that provides a fast and easy way for university students to track courses to take to meet graduation requirements and plan courses to take. The user interacts
with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
