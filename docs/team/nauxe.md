# Project: SOCareers

SOCareers is your ultimate companion to managing your professional connections and internship applications. Designed
with School of Computing (SoC) students in mind, it is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling
you to organise your information more efficiently than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) apps if
you can type fast.
