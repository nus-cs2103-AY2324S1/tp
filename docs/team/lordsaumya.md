### Project: HouR

HouR is a desktop HR management application used for managing and organising personnel data.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Modification**: Change `Person` to `Employee`
    * What it does: It prepares the change from the Person class to Employee class by renaming all instances of Person to Employee, removing unused attributes, and changing methods, docs, and test data accordingly.
    * Justification: The Person class was not suitable to store the data required for the HouR application.

* **New Attribute**: Employee attribute `Position`
    * What it represents: It keeps track of the position of an employee.
    * Justification: Users will need to keep track of employee positions to make changes to their salary and performance metrics.

* **New Feature**: Report command `Report`
    * What it does: It generates and downloads a report of the number of leaves, overtime hours, and overtime pay of an employee in the application.
    * Justification: This allows HR managers to view and store the performance metrics of an employee, allowing them to assess an employee's performance and make decisions regarding the employee's salary and position.
    * Highlights: This feature was challenging to implement as it necessitated the involvement of all of the main 'components' of the system, including the logic, model, UI, and storage.

* **Modification**: Find command `Find`
    * What it does: It extends the find command to allows managers to find employees by other fields, including ID, Name, Department(s), Position, Email, and Phone Number.
    * Justification: This allows managers to find employees by other fields, allowing them to find employees more easily.
    * Highlights: This feature was initially partially implemented by creating separate predicate classes for all of the fields, but was later refactored to use a single predicate class.
