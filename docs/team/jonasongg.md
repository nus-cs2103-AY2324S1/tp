### Project: ClubMembersContacts

ClubMembersContacts is an application that allows users to keep track of their club members' contact information.

Below is a summary of my contributions to the project.

* [Code Contributed](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jonasongg&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)
* Enhancements Implemented:
    * Added and adapted the view member and applicant features for our app
        * Created classes including `ViewMembersCommand`
        * Ensured existing automated tests covered the new commands
    * Added the copy member and applicant features
        * Allows users to copy a member or applicant's information to the clipboard for easy pasting elsewhere
        * Created classes including `CopyMemberCommand`, `CopyMemberCommandParser`, etc.
        * Added new tests for the new commands and ensured existing automated tests (such as for `AddressBookParser`)
          covered the new commands
    * Updated the UI
        * To match our app concept of splitting the member and applicant features, added the separate `Member`
          and `Applicant` columns to the UI
        * Among other UI enhancements, made the command result box wrap text to make it easier for users to read
    * Added command aliases for every command (such as `addm` for `addMember`) to make it easier for users to use the
      app
    * Made commands case-insensitive to make it easier for users to type them
* Contributions to the UG:
    * Wrote the section on viewing all member(s)/applicant(s)
    * Wrote the section on copying a member and copying an applicant
    * Improved the formatting of the UG
        * Increased the width of the page so that the code snippets are not cut off
        * Adjusted the size of images so that they are not too big and flowed better with the document
        * Added callout boxes to highlight important information
        * Ensured formatting was consistent throughout the document
    * Ensured the UG was consistent with the app's features, and that the UG was up-to-date with the latest changes
      made to the app
* Contributions to the DG:
  * Updated the DG and its diagrams and explanations to reflect the changes made to `Person`, `Member`, `Applicant`,
    `DeleteMemberCommand` classes and more
  * Wrote sections and added UML diagrams created with PlantUML explaining the view and copy commands and their
    processes
