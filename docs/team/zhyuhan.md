### Project: Connectify

Connectifyâ€™s codebase, while short, is robust, made with extra care and deliberate design. We focus on creating easy-to-develop yet high quality product for both the users and the developers.

These are my contributions:

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a client's profile details.
  - What it does: Allows the user to view a client's profile details, including contact information and past interactions.
  - Justification: Due to the increase in the amount of client information we need to store, we need a new way for the user to view/review a client's profile and past interactions, which is a key feature of a CRM system.
  - Highlights: This feature introduces a new way to display all of a client's information. The implementation uses of the observer pattern to track the active client profile to display.
- **New Feature**: Designed and created dashboard view.
  - What it does: Displays statistics of the user's client interactions, as well as upcoming follow-ups with clients.
  - Justification: This feature is a key feature of a CRM system, and allows the user to quickly view their progress with clients and follow-ups.
  - Highlights: This feature is a separate view from the main client list view, and required the use of a separate controller and model to handle the data.
  - Credits: @kamiliarsyad for the implementation of the dashboard data model.
