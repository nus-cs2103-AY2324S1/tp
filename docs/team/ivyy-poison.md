### Project: HRMate

HRMate is a desktop address book application that aims to streamline HR processes, by offering an intuitive, CLI-based
contact management system with specialised functionalities for HR tasks. It has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is
written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Project Management**
  * Assessed and reproduced bug reports to provide detailed feedback for further action
  * Set up and allocated issues to team members
  * Iterative and incremental development of HRMate
  * Used forking workflow to contribute to the project

* **New feature**: Added the `delete-tag` command 
  * What it does: Allows HR managers to delete a tag (or a set of tags) from an entry in the address book
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience by allowing users to delete tags from entries
    without having to use the edit command, which is more cumbersome and less intuitive.
  * Pull Request: [[PR#52]](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/pull/52)

* **New feature**: Create the `Leave`, `LeavesBook` and `LeavesBookStorage` classes
  * What it does: Allows HR managers to keep track of employees' leave applications, and perform operations such
    as adding, deleting, approving and rejecting leave applications.
  * Justification: This feature, while not directly functional or command-related, serves as the backbone of a key
    feature of HRMate, which is the ability to keep track of employees' leave applications. This feature is also
    essential for the implementation of the various Leaves commands.
