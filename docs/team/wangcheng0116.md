### Project: Flashlingo

FlashLingo is a desktop application to facilitate the learning of new languages through flashcards. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to start and end review sessions.
    * What it does: allow users to manage review sessions where they can review their flashcards to improve their memory retention.
    * Justification: The implementation of 'start' and 'end' review session capabilities allows users to actively review words, thereby enhancing their memory retention.
    * Highlights: This upgrade impacts both current and future commands, demanding an in-depth analysis of design options. Integrating the Singleton pattern posed challenges, necessitating complex adjustments to existing commands.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wangcheng0116&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos#/)
