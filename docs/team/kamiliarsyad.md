### Project: Connectify
Connectify's codebase, while short, is robust, made with extra care and deliberate design. We focus on creating easy-to-develop yet high quality product for both the users and the developers.

Listed below are my contributions to the project, with most of them being PR reviews:

* **New Feature**: Added `create` command to allow the user to create the required client.
  
* **New Feature**: Added `dashboard` base feature. This includes the commands, base statistics, and the dashboard object encapsulation.

* **New Feature**: Added a history abstraction that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=KamiliArsyad&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)
