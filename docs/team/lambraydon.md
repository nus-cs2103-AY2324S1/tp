### Project: TuitionConnect

TuitionConnect is a desktop app built for tutors and tutoring businesses to simplify the process of administration and finance management, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `ListByDayCommand`
  * What it does: Shows the current list of tutees who have lessons on a specified day
  * Justification: This feature allows private tutors to be reminded if they have any classes on that particular day with a single command
    * Highlights: This feature extends the `ListCommand` class and uses the same command syntax `list` followed by an optional `[DAY]` parameter. If the user does not specify the `[DAY]` parameter, it will be parsed as a `ListCommand` and shows all tutees in the list. If the `[DAY]`
    parameter is included, it will be parsed as a `ListByDayCommand`

* **New Feature**: `Undo`
  * What it does: Undo commands that alter the data of tutees such as `delete`, `add` and `edit`
  * Justification: This feature allows private tutors to efficiently undo commands if they made a mistake.
    * Highlights: This feature saves the state of the `VersionedAddressBook` after every command that alters the data of tutees into  temporary memory which will be cleared everytime the application is closed

* **New Feature**: `Redo`
  * What it does: Redo undo commands that alter the data of tutees such as `delete`, `add` and `edit`
  * Justification: This feature allows private tutors to efficiently redo commands if they made a mistake.

* **New Feature**: Created a `ScheduleList` that is displayed on the UI as a `ScheduleListPanel` which allows tutor to view upcoming lessons.
  *  What it does: Sorts a private tutor's lessons according the day and time so in an `ObservableList`.
  *  Justification: This feature allows private tutors to easily glance their schedule for the week.
  *  Highlights: This features requires a `Lesson` Class that encapsulates the `Day`, `Begin` and `End` fields in an `add` command. `Lesson` objects are than sorted using a `LessonComparator`
