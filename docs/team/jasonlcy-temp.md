### Project: InterviewHub

InterviewHub is a desktop application that helps engineering hiring managers to manage applicants and interviews.
The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created
with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 18 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Interview (add-i, edit-i, list-i, delete-i)
  * What it does: Allows the user to perform CRUD operations for an Interview object
  * Justification: The basic CRUD features of `Interview` serves as the crucial foundation of our product,
alongside AB3's Person which was adapted into Applicant by Jing Jie. Most of the code for Interview was implemented by me,
adapting the frame of AB3's Person class CRUD classes. Implementing it was a lot more challenging than initially expected
due to how many additional classes (~20 associated classes) had to be edited, some a lot more heavily than others,
in order to handle the `Interview` object properly through all levels of abstraction - From the stored Json datafile
all the way up the abstraction ladder (Model, AddressBook etc.) to the ObservableList used to display the data on the UI.

* **Project management**:
  * Created the organization and team on GitHub
  * Created the team repo on GitHub (including setting up `CodeCov` CI)
  * Kept track of deadlines (internal and external) and performed issue tracking & scheduling for milestone `v1.1 and v1.2`
  * Performed standardization of GitHub issues (Task Tracker) and tags for `v1.1 - v1.4`
  * Enabled assertions for the team repo
  * Updated codecov global YAML to be more permissive with test case coverage decrease


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * `add-i`, `edit-i`, `delete-i` and `list-i` commands
    * Ensured functionality and correctness of UG hyperlinks
    * Misc. enhancements to the UG
  * Developer Guide:
    * `add-i` command
    * All use Cases for `v1.1` and `v1.4`
  * Removed most traces of AB3 from the markdown pages, UG and DG in `v1.1`
  * Adapted index, readme, etc. from AB3 to our product
