### Project: Connectify

Connectify is a networking platform designed to help SOC students efficiently manage their connections and enhance their networking experiences.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Created Skeleton for Company Class [\#41](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/41) [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/48)
  * Created the skeleton code and wrote test cases for the Company class, which serves as a fundamental component for managing company-related information.
  * Significance: Utilized parameters of type String to set the groundwork for future refactoring of the Company class according to OOP principles. Refactoring of the Company class was based off the skeleton code and test cases.

* **New Feature**: Implemented PersonList Object [\#44](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/44) [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/64)
  * Introduced the PersonList object, following Object-Oriented Programming principles to enable companies to maintain a list of people associated with them. Also wrote test cases for the PersonList object.
  * Significance: The PersonList object is a fundamental component of the project, as it allows the Company class to store contacts associated with it. The PersonList object is also a key component of the Company class, which is a fundamental component of the project.

  * Implemented the `editCompany` command (including editCompanyCommandParser file), enabling users to edit the details of their company contacts. Also wrote test cases for the `editCompany` command.
  * Significance: Enables user to keep their company contacts up-to-date, which is crucial in network management.
