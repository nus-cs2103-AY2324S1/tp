### Project: TutorConnect

This is an address book made for tuition centre managers to easily track, schedule, and notify tutors of their upcoming schedule, optimised for users who prefer a CLI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**:
  * [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ruishanteo&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **New feature**: Added the ability to edit schedules. (Pull request [#136](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/136), [#171](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/171))
    * What it does: Allows the user to edit schedules.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to modify start and end time of schedules 
      that are in the address book.
  * **New feature**: Added the ability to change theme. (Pull request [#197](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/197))
    * What it does: Allows user to change colour themes.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to view the address book with different 
      colour palettes.
    * Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it required parsing the theme input (e.g. `dark`) and 
      assigning the filepath for the style to be used on top of parsing the command (i.e. `theme`). This feature also 
      required modifications to `UserPrefs` in order to save the previously used theme.
  * **Refactored feature**: Refactored the AddCommand to AddTutorCommand. (Pull request [#61](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/61))
    * What it does: Add tutors to the address book.
    * Highlights: Safe removal of address and tags of a `Person` object.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide (Pull requests [#51](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/51), [#149](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/149), [#195](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/195), [#239](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/239))
