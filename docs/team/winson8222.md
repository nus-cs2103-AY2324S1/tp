### Project: lesSON

lesSON is a desktop flashcard application for Computing students in University who struggle with
memorisation and consolidation of knowledge. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Deck and Cards Operations [#66](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/66):
  * What it does: Allow the user to perform the basic operations based on the Card class by taking in the
  parameters required,
  * Highlights: Users can now input add and edit commands based on the parameters specified by each
  command. 


* **New Feature**: Practise ([#71](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/71), [#92](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/92))
  * What it does: Allows users to look at the question of a specific card using its index.
  * Justification: It allows users to test his knowledge under exam condition.
  * Highlights: Practise allows users to access only the question of a flashcard, if command is entered without index, the flashcard at the top of the list will be practised.



* **New Feature**: Solve ([#92](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/92), [#95](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/95))
  * What it does: Allows user to look at the answer of a specific card  using its index.
  * Justification: It is the main practical function of a flashcard application for users to learn from his mistake
  * Highlights: Solve command reveals the answer to a flashcard to the users.


* **New Feature**: Set Difficulty [#95](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/95)
  * What it does: Allows user to set a specific difficulty level for a question of a flashcard using its index.
  * Justification: It is the main practical function of a flashcard application for users to evaluate the question
  solving process and the application and schedule their next practise based on the difficulty input.
  * Highlights: Users set a level of difficulty (easy, medium or hard) for a question using `set` command, the deck of card will then be rearranged according to the new schedule.


* **New Feature** MarkDown Syntax [#117](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/117)
  * What it does: For advanced user who wish to stylised their flashcard or are visual learners, having ways to differentiate
  words by having different style can greatly enhance their learning process.
  * Justification: It serves as a good supplementary function to enhance to current revision process for user.
  * Highlights: Based on the syntax entered by the user, the corresponding styling will be reflected on
  the display card and the result view.
