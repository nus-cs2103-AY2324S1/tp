### Project: NetworkBook

NetworkBook is a desktop address book application 
that School of Computing students can use to track and
network with peers. The user interacts with it using
a CLI, and has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written
in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Here are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added checks for duplicate contact names.
* **Code contributed**: [tP Dashboard Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=eola-z&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Eola-Z&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `remove duplicates`,
        `course` and `specialisation`

Here are some extracts from my contributions to the 
user guide:

* Description of `specialisation`:
  * > You can add a specialisation to an existing contact.  
  A new specialisation will be added to the contact's list 
  of specialisations, and no new contact will be created.
  Specialisations are displayed in the order they are added.
* Format:
  * `add /spec [specialisation] /index [index]`
* UI mockups:
  * Created the UI mockups in the user guide to emulate
  the application's behavior.
