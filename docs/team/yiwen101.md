### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. It allows faster access and storage of studentsâ€™ contacts and data, providing better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only. The app will only provide simple student analytics (without detailed student progress analysis).
