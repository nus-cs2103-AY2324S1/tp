### Project: InterviewHub

InterviewHub - A CLI app for engineering managers to manage interviews and interviewees

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Accept multiple time formats**: Added the ability to accept multiple time formats.
    * What it does: Allows the user to enter a time in different formats
    * Justification: Different individuals have different ways of entering dates
    * Highlights: This feature increases the flexibility of the command, 
      allowing the user to type in inputs without the input being rejected, leading to better UX.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
