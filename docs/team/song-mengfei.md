### Project: Flashlingo

FlashLingo is a desktop application to facilitate the learning of new languages through flashcards. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Added the ability to update the proficiency level of reviewed flash cards.
      * What it does: It receives the user's feedback on the flash card and updates the proficiency level of the flash card accordingly.
      * Justification: The implementation of `Yes` and `No` commands allows users to actively review words, thereby enhancing their memory retention.
      * Highlights: This upgrade impacts both current and future commands, demanding an in-depth analysis of design options. Integrating the Singleton pattern posed challenges, necessitating complex adjustments to existing commands.
  * Added the ability to filter flash cards by their language or review date.
      * What it does: It lists all flash cards with the specified language or the review date before the given date.
      * Justification: The implementation of `Review` and `Language` command allows users to view all flash cards in the flash card list.
      * Highlights: This upgrade impacts both current and future commands, demanding an in-depth analysis of design options. Integrating the Singleton pattern posed challenges, necessitating complex adjustments to existing commands.
