### Project: HouR

HouR is a desktop HR management application used for managing and organising personnel data.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Overtime Feature `overtime`
    * What it does: Allows the user to add overtime hours to a specified employee.
    * Justification: Overtime hours tracking does not follow a fixed schedule, and is often ad-hoc. 
    With this feature, HR managers will be able to keep track of the overtime hours taken by respective employees
    in an organised manner.
    * Highlights: Maximum overtime hours allowed is 72 hours per month, in accordance with the Employment Act.
    Trying to add overtime hours that exceed this limit will result in an error message being displayed.
