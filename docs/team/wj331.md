# Project: ClinicAssistant

## Overview
ClinicAssistant is a desktop application used by General Practitioner clinics' admin staff for patient contact management. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Code Contributed: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wj331&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)

### Enhancements implemented:
**Feature enhancement:** Changed formatting and strings for `delete` command which deletes the person according to
`index` shown on list (Pull request [#41](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/pull/41/))
- What it does: Enables users to delete patients based on the `index` of the patient they see on the patient list
- Justification: By allowing to delete by `index`, it is much more convenient for users as they do not have to type
  the full names of the patients. Furthermore, `index` on the list is unique while fields such as `name` is not

**New Feature:** Implemented the `Age`, `Gender` and `Ethnicity` class used for person's details (Pull
request [#51](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/pull/51/))
- What it does: Users will now be able to easily store a patient's essential information
  such as `Age`, `Gender` and `Ethnicity`. This can help clinic staff to better identify patients' needs such as Gender or Age sensitive treatments
- Justification: `Age`, `Gender` and `Ethnicity` are essential fields which our group felt was essential clinic assistants
  to store which can be critical to their treatment. Hence, we have made them mandatory to be included in a patient's
  details so clinic assistants can have these fields at their disposal.

**New Feature:** Implemented the `Timeslot` class used to represent timeslots in a day (Pull
request [#104](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/pull/104/))
- What it does: Splits the opening hours of the clinic into fixed timeslots which can be used later to book appointments for
  patients. A Timeslot will have 2 fields: `date` and `hour` which represents the date and time of the Timeslot.
- Justification: Our team has agreed that the operating hours of the clinic will be from 09:00 to 17:00 everyday. To buffer for any
  overrun of appointments and give the doctor sufficient rest, the operating hours is divided into 1 hour timeslots
  that can be used by clinic assistants to book appointments.

**New Feature:** Implemented the `ViewAvailableCommand` class used to view all available timeslots for a date (Pull
request [#104](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/pull/104/))
- What it does: Allows the user to be able to view all available timeslots for any date
  they want. Users can input the `date` which they want to view and instantly gets all available timeslots on that `date` and
  subsequently use it to book an appointment.
- Justification: Having a list of all booked appointments is good but not good enough for a clinic assistant. This command
  will help him/her to filter through all appointments for the date and return all available timeslots so that he/she can book the appointment
  in an instant.
