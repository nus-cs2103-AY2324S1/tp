### Project: lesSON

lesSON is a desktop flashcard application for Computing students in University who struggle with
memorisation and consolidation of knowledge. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
