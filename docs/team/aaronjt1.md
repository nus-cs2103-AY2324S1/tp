## Project: Advanced&Efficient (A&E)

Advanced&Efficient helps Emergency Department (ED) doctors in logging patient reports and connecting patients with
relevant departments.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Contribution

Here are my [contributions](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=aaronjt1&breakdown=true) to the
project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Features implemented

View Feature [#119](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/119)

**What it does** - Allows users to view the information of a specific patient with `Ic Number`

**Justification** - Currently there is a find command which allows users to find patients by keywords in names. However
if a user wants to search for a specific patient with Ic Number, there is no option for that. Since find returns a list
of patients with names matching the keyword, the user would have to manually go through the list to find that specific
patient.

**Highlights** - Since Add command is enhanced to prevent patients with duplicate `Ic Number` from being added, users
can be assured that the displayed user is the one they desired.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Enhancement to existing features:

#### Enhanced Add Feature

1. Option to add patients with required fields only [#78](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/78)
2. Prevent patient with `IC Number` that already exists in system from being
   added. [#128](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/128)

#### Enhanced exception / error messages for users

1. `PatientWithFieldNotFoundException` thrown when no patient with user-specified field
   found [#119](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/119)
2. Integrated `PatientWithFieldNotFoundException` into all relevant
   commands [#153](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/153)

#### Enhanced `ModelManager` [#128](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/128)

1. `isPatientWithIcNumberPresent` method to check if a patient with the `Ic Number` is present
2. `getCurrentPatientList` method to get current patients in the patient record rather than filtered list
3. Testing utilities for the above mentioned methods. in `ModelManagerTest.java`.

#### Enhanced testing utilities

1. Account for new Patient
   attributes [#102](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/102), [#116](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/116)
2. Significantly improved coverage for AddCommandParser, EditCommandParser,
   AddressBookParser [#78](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/78), [#160](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/160)
3. Added testing for AssignCommand feature [#163](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/pull/163)
