### Class Enhancements

1. **Introduced `Path` Class :**
    - Provided a structured way to manage and manipulate paths in our application.
    - This class assists other classes in providing functionality such as navigating
      between directories and executing commands against specific paths.
2. **Introduced `Id` class :**
    - Represent unique id of group and student.
3. **Introduced `Option` class :**
    - Similar to AB3 `Prefix` class, but with shorthand and longhand names.
    - e.g. Name option can be passed using option `--name` or `-n`.
4. **Introduced `Displayable` interface :**
    - Classes that implement this interface can be displayed in the `ItemListPanel`.
    - e.g. `ToDo`, `Deadline`, `Student` and `Group`.
5. **Refactored `ArgumentTokenizer` class :**
    - Refactored `ArgumentTokenizer` class to adopt `Option` class.
6. **Added validation for options:**
    - Implemented validation to check for invalid options in every command.
    - An error will be thrown if the user provides an option that is not applicable for a specific command.

### New Features

1. **`cd` Command :** Allows users to navigate between different directories.
2. **`ls` Command :** Shows a list of directories under the current directory.
3. **`cat` Command :** Displays the task list under a specific path.
