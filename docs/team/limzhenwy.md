### Project: FAPro

FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to keep track of large numbers of contacts. It allows FAs to have a one-stop platform to manage their contacts and conduct financial analytics while providing a big-picture view of their clientele as a whole.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: find_add 
  * What it does: Adds functionality to be able to search by client's address
  * Justification: As a Financial Advisor, I want to find my clients by address, so that I can line up appointments without having to go through the entire list.
  * Highlights: This was the first time I did any non-trivial changes to existing code. It was a great experience to put what I learnt in the adding command tutorial to practical use.
  

* **New Feature**: cal
* What it does: Adds functionality to be able to search by client's appointment date
* Justification: As a Financial Advisor, I want to be able to search a date, so that I can see all the appointments I have for that day.
* Highlights: This was an interesting addition because I am now searching for a parameter that was newly created by a teammate. While using the debugging tool, it allowed me to get a good understanding of my teammate's implementation of the parameter.


* **New Feature**: ufind
* What it does: Adds functionality to be able to search by name, address, or appointment date in one "unified find" command
* Justification: As a busy financial advisor, I want an easier way to find for address, name, and appointment dates.
