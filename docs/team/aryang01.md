### Project: CheckMate

CheckMate is designed to streamline the process of room bookings for hotel employees. With an emphasis on efficient room-person matching using the Gale-Shapley algorithm, it offers real-time room search, service scheduling, and amenity management. Optimized for administrative roles, it ensures that room allocation and guest needs are seamlessly addressed.
