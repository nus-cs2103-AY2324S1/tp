### Project: ManaGease

ManaGease - Contact management app to simplify and centralize information for full-time employees. It offers easy access to identity information, attendance status, and payroll status of employees. With all the information, the app can help with leave tracking and auto-generation of payrolls and payslips for employees. This helps to reduce errors and enhance overall operational efficiency, leading to time and cost savings, employee engagement and regulatory compliance, and a smoother workflow for your business.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Read a specific field from a particular employee.
  * What it does: Allow the user to read a specific field from a particular employee.
  * Justification: The significance of this feature lies in its ability to enhance the application's efficiency. By enabling users to target and extract information from a specific field for a particular employee, it streamlines the process of navigating through the list of person cards in the application. This not only saves valuable time but also ensures more precise and focused access to the required data.
  * Highlights: The adjustment involves the necessity to incorporate checks for different prefixes to appropriately showcase specific fields. Additionally, modifications to the Person Cards have been implemented, refining their display to emphasize only the specified field. 
    
* **New Feature**: View the employee who is on leave on a specific date
  * What it does: Allow the user to view the employee who is on leave on a specific date
  * Justification: The significance of this feature lies in its ability to enhance the application's tracking ability. It provides users with a quick and efficient way to identify employees on leave on any given date.

* **Enhancement**: Added a clock and calendar to UI
  * What it does: Allow the user to visualize the number of employees on leave for each day on the calendar.
  * Justification: It provides users with a quick overview of the number of employees on leave. The feature contributes to a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, improving overall application usability.
