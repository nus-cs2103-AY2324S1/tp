### Project: ManaGease

ManaGease - Contact management app to simplify and centralize information for full-time employees.
It offers easy access to identity information, attendance status, and payroll status of employees. With all the information, the app can help with leave tracking and auto-generation of payrolls and payslips for employees. This helps to reduce errors and enhance overall operational efficiency, leading to time and cost savings, employee engagement and regulatory compliance, and a smoother workflow for your business.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add deductions and benefits to employees' salary.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add deductions and benefits to employees' salary.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial to the effectiveness of the application because it allows the user to manipulate and manage any change to employees' salaries. Meanwhile, deductions and benefits are added together with valid reasons, and this increases the traceability of any possible error in the manipulation of monthly payroll.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to generate payslips for employees.
  * What it does: Allows the user to generate payslips for employees.
  * Justification: This feature is crucial to the effectiveness of the application because it allows the user to calculate and manage employees' payroll on a given template in PDF format. The template meets the legal requirements of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in Singapore, where companies must keep meticulous records of employees' payrolls.
