## Jaryl Goh Jun Zhong's Project Portfolio Page

### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners in Singapore to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Here are some of the features JobFestGo has to offer:
- Adding contacts
- Filtering contacts based on tags
- Adding and deleting tags
- Adding events
- Viewing tasks and contacts related to an event

It is an application that is meant to streamline daily operations that job event planners are required to do, while also tapping on their ability to use a Command Line Interface.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=rionshocker&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  - Implemented the `delete_tag` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to delete tags added to JobFestGo.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product as it gives the user a chance to delete tags that they might have mistakenly keyed in and would like to delete them.
    - Highlights: This enhancement was slightly challenging due to the need to remove the deleted tag from the contacts that have the existing tag.
  - Implemented the `select_event` feature
    - What it does: allows the user to select the event and view its respective contacts and tasks.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides the user with ease of viewing the tasks that needs to be handled in an event as well as contacts associated to the event.
    - Highlights: This enhancement touches on the UI component, to display that a particular event has been selected. The implementation was slightly challenging in view of the connection between frontend and backend implementation.
  - Handled the UI component of the project
    - Did up the MainWindow display of the application to have 3 columns, and ensuring that the flow of events followed by entering a command is valid.
    - Highlights: It was slightly time-consuming having to learn JavaFX and applying it on the project.
  - In charge of linking backend implementations to frontend
