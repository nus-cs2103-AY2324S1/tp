# Neo Jie Xiang's Project Portfolio Page

### Project: D.A.V.E.

D.A.V.E. is a leads and clients management tool for student financial advisors specifically in NUS, but can be used for all student financial advisors.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Made the `Person` class abstract and created the `Client` and `Lead` subclasses.
  * What it does: Allows the `Client` and `Lead` classes to both possess features in common with `Person`, but have their own specific behavior.
  * Justification: This feature reduces code repetition and improves code quality as it follows the OOP model more closely.
  * Highlights: This feature had to be completed before all other features and commands can be implemented, and thus had to be carefully planned.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view all persons sorted by their meeting times.
  * What it does: This feature filters out the persons with a meeting time and displays them in chronological order.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience by allowing them to keep track of meeting times more easily.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to directly add a meeting time to a person.
  * What it does: This feature allows users to directly add a meeting time to a person instead of doing it through the `edit` command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience by providing a simpler and more direct way to add a meeting time.

* **Project Management**:
  * Managed release `v1.2` on GitHub.
* **Enhancement to existing features**:
  * Added test cases for features that I have implemented to increase test coverage.
  * Made the command datetime parsing strict to catch invalid date and time values entered.
  * Fix bug caused by calling `toString` on the wrong objects, which caused some tests to fail.
  * Fix bug caused by not checking if `keyMilestone` is null for leads after deserialization from JSON, which caused a `NullPointerException` on launch.
* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Expanded the table of contents to include all commands and ensuring that the hyperlinks worked.
    * Added documentation for `addmeeting` and `sortmeeting`.
    * Fixed some of the broken tip and warning boxes.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Incorporated change to `Person` model and the new `Lead` and `Client` subclasses to the class diagrams.
    * Added implementation and sequence diagram for the `sortmeeting` command.
    * Fixed bugs in existing sequence diagrams, as well as simplified and adjusted their sizes to fit the final PDF.
* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#88](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/88), [\#100](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/100), [\#113](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/113),
  [\#180](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/180), [\#184](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/184), [\#195](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/195), [\#197](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/197), [#200](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/200), [\#205](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-2/tp/pull/205).
  * Created `type`, `severity`, and `priority` labels for issues.
  * Labelled relevant issues and added them to their milestones.
* **Tools**:
  * Created UML diagrams using PlantUML.
  * Used the GitHub CLI to check out and test the pull requests branches.
