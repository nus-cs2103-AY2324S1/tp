### Project: JobFestGo

JobFestGo is a **desktop application** built for job event planners in Singapore to manage contacts and tasks for their events.

Features of JobFestGo include:
- Adding contacts
- Adding events
- Adding tasks
- Reminders for tasks

It is a management tool meant to assist you in effectively, efficiently managing your tasks and contacts for events.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=vijay-shankaranand&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    - Improved the `add_contact` feature
        - What it does: allows the user to add contacts into JobFestGo with optional tag.
        - Justification: Improved the feature to only allow tags that have already been added to JobFestGo for filter by tag feature.
    - Implemented the `add_event` feature
        - What it does: allows the user to add an event.
        - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to add their events to keep track of their upcoming/past events.
        - Highlights: This enhancement adds a new class to JobFestGo. This enhancement was challenging as there was a need to refactor certain parts of contact class to use for event class to minimize code duplication.
    - Implemented the reminder feature
        - What it does: reminds the users on tasks that are due within the next 3 days when they start up JobFestGo.
        - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides the user a way to be reminded of their upcoming tasks so as to not forget completing them on time.
        - Highlights: Figuring out the logic to implement this feature was challenging as there was a need to check if the task is due within the next 3 days and if the task is not marked as done using a new predicate.
