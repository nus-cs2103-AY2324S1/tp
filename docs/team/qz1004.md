### Project: OutBook

OutBook is a desktop application designed for freelance insurance agents, enabling them to effectively organize and oversee their extensive contacts and meeting schedules. It is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI) and aims to significantly reduce the time needed for organizational tasks.


My contributions to the project are listed below

- **New Feature**: Added a command (`addmc`) that allows user to add an attendee to a meeting. (Pull request [#55](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/pull/55))
  - What it does: Allows the user to add a person as an attendee to a specified meeting
  - Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of who will be attending each meeting, to ensure the user is aware of and addresses their needs.
- **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and edit the `Status` of a contact (Pull Request [#72](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/pull/72))
  - What it does: Allows the user to specify which stage of the insurance sales process each of their contact is at, if applicable. A fixed list of available statuses tailored for insurance agents is provided.
  - Justification: Insurance agents typically have to address different issues depending on which stage of the sales process their client is at. Hence, the Status field is created to help users segment their contacts systematically and update each contact's status easily.
