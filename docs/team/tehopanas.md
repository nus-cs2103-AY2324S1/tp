## Project EzContact

EzContact is a desktop app made for insurance agents to manage customer details,
optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EzContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

###### **New Feature**:
* Implemented `Insurance` feature that includes a new `insurance` command and a new attribute to the customers in our EzContact.
  * What it does: User can assign or remove insurances associated with a customer on EzContact, by providing the name of the insurance.
  * Justification: Given that our users are insurance agents, our users have to constantly keep track of what insurances each customer
currently holds, has interest in or plans to cancel. With this feature, our users can efficiently keep track of these information and make the
correct decisions and moves when interacting with their customers, subsequently increasing their efficiency and chances of securing deals.
  * Highlights: Implementation of this feature requires in-depth analysis of the model component, different data structures to handle the information
and handling of user behaviours (e.g. duplicate, conflicting insurances). These analysis determine our design choices from all the possible alternatives.
