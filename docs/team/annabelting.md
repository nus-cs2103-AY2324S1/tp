### Project: CheckMate

CheckMate is designed to streamline the process of room bookings by hotel employees. With a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the necessary information needed at a glance, and the application
being optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), we have combined elegance and efficiency when it comes to
the process of room booking by hotel receptionists.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: (Coming Soon) Set-up command to allow users to customise the app to their infrastructure.
  * What it does: This allows the CheckMate to be customised according to the needs of the hotel by enabling the user to
  set up the required number of rooms for each room tier offered.
  * Justification: Different hotels have different room set-up and may require more rooms of certain tiers but less of others.
  This would enable CheckMate to better cater to their unique needs.
  * Highlights: The storage system would need to be modified to store the set-up conditions.

* **Code contributed**:

* **Project management**: 
  * Created and managed issues to keep track of tasks to be completed by the team. (Issue [#199](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/issues/199), [#200](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/issues/200))
  * Extensively tested out our application to find bugs. (Pull Request [#283](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/pull/283))

* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
  * Added booking comparison method that ensures all bookings recorded in CheckMate is unique to prevent conflicting schedules.
  * Fix bugs found in the PED. (Pull Request [#259](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/issues/259))

* **Documentation**: 
  * Ensured screenshots in the user guide remained up-to-date by repeatedly updating it. 
  Ensured that usage details are clear and added in example details and additional information about field constraints.
  * Added descriptions for the tag feature in the developer guide.

* **Community**: 
  * Provided 11 bug reports for another team.
  * Looked through peer's code and provided feedback.
