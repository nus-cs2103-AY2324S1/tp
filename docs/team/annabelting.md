### Project: CheckMate

CheckMate is designed to streamline the process of room bookings for hotel employees. With a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the necessary information needed at a glance, and the application
being optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), we have combined elegance and efficiency when it comes to
the process of room booking for hotel receptionists.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: (Coming Soon) Set-up command to allow users to customise the app to their infrastructure.
