## Tan Tze Young's Project Portfolio Page

### Project: [Ba]king [Br]ead

[Ba]king [Br]ead is a desktop inventory and recipe book management application that allows users to add ingredients and view
recipes. The user interacts with it through a CLI. The GUI is implemented using JavaFX and the project is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to view specific recipes.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view a specific recipe by using the recipe's unique identifier.
  * Justification: This feature is critical to the working of the product as a user needs to be able to view the steps 
  and ingredients in each recipe.
  * Highlights: This enhancement relied on the UnqiueId class which meant that the Index class from Addressbook3 cannot
  be reused. Much thought had went into considering the implementation and integration of the UniqueId class with this
  command.

* **Enhancement:** Enhanced the UI of the app (Pull requests 
[\#78](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/pull/78), 
[\#89](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/pull/89),
[\#110](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F10-3/tp/pull/110))
  * Updated the styling of the UI, which includes colour scheme, borders and fonts changes. 
  * Implemented the ability for the RecipeListPanel to change from listing recipes to showing a single recipe with full
  details of the recipe
  * Changed the icons of the app to suit the theme of baking
  * Improved the layout of each individual list tile for the ingredient list tile and the recipe list tiles.
