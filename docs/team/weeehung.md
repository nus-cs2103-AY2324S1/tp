## Project: HealthSync

HealthSync is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:

  1. Added fields like ID, Appointment and Medical Histories.
        * What it does: Allows for necessary fields to be included in the profile
        * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now see the ID, appointment timings and medical history at one glance, since all information are bundled in a patient card. This caters to the needs of front desk staff who need to quickly identify patients, their medical histories and arrange appointments.
        * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing models, commands and test cases.

  2. Added logger tab UI to show logged profiles
      * What it does: Allows for logs to be pinned at the right panel of the application
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now utilise the logger like a memo.
      * Highlights: This enhancement affects log commands. The Person Cards UI are consistent in both the Logger Tab and Patient List View.

  3. Added Menu Sidebar UI
      * What it does: It shows users miscellaneous actions that can be performed in the application (ie. Help, Settings, Exit).
      * Justification: This feature provides a more intuitive way for users to navigate the application. It also supports future integration of file settings and help features.
      * Highlights: The buttons present in this sidebar have their corresponding shortcuts and can be executed through command text box.

  4. Added `spacebar` key shortcut
      * What it does:  Allows users to jump to command text box without using mouse to click on command text box
      * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it caters to the habits and characteristics of fast typists.
      * Highlights: This enhancement does not affect other components and is standalone. For future implementations of settings, we can allow users to pick their preferred shortcuts.
