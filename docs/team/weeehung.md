### Project: HealthSync

HealthSync is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added fields like NRIC, Appointment and Medical Histories.
  * What it does: Allows for necessary fields to be included in the profile
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now see the NRIC, appointment timings and medical history at one glance, since all information are bundled in a patient card.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing models, commands and test cases.

* **New Feature**: Added logger tab UI to show logged profiles
  * What it does: Allows for logs to be pinned at the corner of the application
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now utilise the logger like a memo.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects log commands.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2.1` (1 release) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Added new fields necessary for patient tracking
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Updated the frontend design of application, including medical history tags and logger tabs.
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 75% to XX% (Pull requests [\#63](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `autosave` [\#30](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/30)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added Product Scope which includes target user profile and value proposition.
    * Added user stories and sort them in terms of priority

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#74](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/74), [\#82](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/82)
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [#253]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [XX]())
  * New fields implemented by me are adopted by the team ([#63](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/63))

* **Tools**:
  * Utitlised JavaFx Scene Builder for building the frontend of the project ([\#XX]())
