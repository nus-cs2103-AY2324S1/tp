### Project: TAManager

TAManager is a desktop address book application made for professors to manage their teaching assistants (TA) under their charge. It provides fast access to TAs' contact details and their availabilities for tutorials/labs. You can track teaching and claimable hours among your TAs and find relief TAs for impromptu events or unforeseen circumstances.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to assign a course to a TA.
    * What it does: Allows the user to assign a course to a TA.
    * Justification: A professor may have multiple courses that he is teaching. Hence, it is important to keep track of which TA is assigned to which course.
    * Highlights: This required me to tweak the UI slightly to represent the course, and write extensive testcases to ensure the correct behavior.

* **New Feature**: Refactored Course to include name and lesson data.
    * What it does: Allows the app to store the course information of a specific course.
    * Justification: This lays the foundation for the course command, and possible future commands.
    * Highlights: The course was initially implemented to extend from Tag, but as expectations evolved for courses to include information such as lesson slots, I had to refactor the code to make it more extensible.
