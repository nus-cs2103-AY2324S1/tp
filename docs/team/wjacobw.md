### Project: NUSearch

NUSearch is a desktop application used for consolidating NUS professors, teaching assistants (TAs) and studentsâ€™ profiles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, it has a GUI created with JavaFX, and is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* What it does: Allows a user to get the list of all people with their own information (Name, courses, tutorial, contacts, role)
* Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of all the people on the list

#### Help Feature
* What it does: This feature allows user to know the formats of all the commands that can be used
* Justification: This feature allows user to easily use the application
