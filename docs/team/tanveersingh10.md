### Project: MediLink Contacts

MediLink Contacts aims to help medical staff including nurses/doctors navigate through patient details in
their high workload and time-pressured working environment. When medical emergencies arise, it becomes crucial to
provide rapid access to emergency contacts for patients and access other details of the patients to make decisions more
quickly. It is optimised for CLI so that users can quickly access the information. There is also a GUI created with
JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**:

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the Edit Command
  * What it does: allows to update fields of a doctor or patient.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes and may need to change details of a person. Alternatively, it's possible a 
  person's details change over time, such as their condition or remarks, and there needs to be a quick way to update the information.

* **Project management**:
  * Led the ideation process. Had to find a balance between new features and ensuring current features are bug free.
  * Helped delegate issues and tickets
  * Did Peer Reviews on other teammates' Pull Requests
  * Resolved Merge Conflicts where applicable

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase test coverage.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `edit`, `undo` and `redo`
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `edit` feature.
