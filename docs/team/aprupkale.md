### Project: LetsGetHired

_LetsGetHired_ is a **desktop application** designed to assist you in
efficiently **tracking and managing your
internship applications and their progress**.

In addition to these capabilities, we recognize the importance of **speed and
efficiency**. Thus, _LetsGetHired_ is
**optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, but you still enjoy
the advantages of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you are a swift typist, _LetsGetHired_ can streamline your internship
tracking **faster than many standard
GUI-based tools available.**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New feature**: Added the command `NoteCommand` and its
  parser `NoteCommandParser` [#57](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/57)
    * _What it does_: Adds a note to an internship application or deletes a note
      from an internship application
    * _Justification_: Allows users to write notes to include background
      information on the company
    * _Highlights_: Has been further improved by other developers to have
      separate commands for note addition and deletion

* **Enhancements to existing feature**: Improved the command `FindCommand` and
  its
  parser `FindCommandParser` [#82](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/82)
    * _What it does_: Finds all internship applications that match either of the
      keyword and prefix pairs entered
    * _Justification_: Allows users to search for internship applications easily
      by any value for any of the fields
    * _Highlights_: Was initially implemented to search for internship
      application only by company name
