## Project: WedLog

WedLog is a desktop application created for partners getting married that helps them manage the guests and vendors involved in the wedding. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. This project is based on [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features

1. **New Feature**: Modified some fields to be optional for guests and vendors.
   * What it does: allows the user to leave optional fields empty for guests and vendors.
   * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may not want to specify all the fields of a guest or vendor, and the app should provide the flexibility for the user to do so.
   * Credits: Partially adapted from [AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-3](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/).

2. **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit vendors.
   * What it does: allows the user to edit fields of a vendor.
   * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to modify vendor information and the app should provide an easy way to do so without having to remove and add back the vendor.
   * Highlights: The implementation was challenging because vendors have optional fields which can be removed by using empty prefixes in the edit command. This required a careful consideration of design alternatives.

3. **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
   * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
   * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
   * Credits: Adapted from [AddressBook Level-4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4).
