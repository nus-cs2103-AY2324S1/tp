### 1. Features implemented
* **New Feature**: Added the `link` field to tasks [#74](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/74)
  * What it does: Allows the user to include references for the task.
  * Justification: The user (CS professors) often has the need for references. This feature enables the user to view their references at a glance. This makes ProfPlan better tailored to the user's needs.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing `add` and `edit` commands. It required much analysis of the user's needs regarding their needs for references. The chosen implementation takes into account the fact that Professors not only use URLs for referenecs, but also books and other hardcopy literature, etc.
  * Credits: Code written for this feature is original.

* **New Feature**: Added the `stats` command to view statistics [#155](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/155)
  * What it does: Shows the users statistics about their tasks.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to view a high-level summary of their tasks, providing motivation for them to complete them.
  * Credits: Code written for this feature is original.

* **New Feature**: Added significant capabilities to the `help` command [#127](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/pull/127)
  * What it does:
    1. Lists all commands and their usage when no arguments supplied
    1. Shows more details description and usage of commands when a command is supplied as an argument
  * Justification: This feature guides new users to better navigate ProfPlan, instead of diverting users to the user guide. This saves much time for users.
