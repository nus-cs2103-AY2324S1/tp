Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a payroll command to allow users to calculate the monthly payroll of an employee
  * What it does: Allows users to perform advanced payroll calculations with precision by managing employees' salaries seamlessly.
  * Justification: This feature is essential for effective salary management, providing users with the flexibility to manipulate and manage changes to employees' salaries. Deductions and benefits, along with valid reasons, are seamlessly integrated, enhancing traceability and minimizing the risk of errors in monthly payroll operations.
  * Highlights: The introduction of this feature required careful design considerations, including the creation of a new storage system using JSON files. This enhancement not only elevates current payroll capabilities but also sets the stage for future functionalities, ensuring the application remains at the forefront of HR administration.
  

* **New Enhancement**: Monthly Payroll, Deductions, and Benefits Storage Using JSON
  * Monthly Payrolls Storage Enhancement: Implemented a JSON file to store monthly payrolls for each employee. This enhancement enhances data organization, providing a structured and accessible repository for historical payroll data. It ensures a seamless retrieval process for future reference or audits.
  * Deductions and Benefits Storage Enhancement: Extended the JSON file approach to store monthly deductions and benefits for individual employees. This enhancement not only centralizes the information but also improves traceability by associating reasons with each deduction or benefit. The structured JSON format facilitates easy modification and retrieval of this critical financial data.
  * Overall Justification: The transition to JSON-based storage for monthly payrolls, deductions, and benefits brings a layer of transparency and efficiency to ManaGease. It simplifies data management, reduces the likelihood of errors, and ensures that historical financial information is easily accessible. This enhancement aligns with the overarching goal of creating a robust and user-friendly HR management system.
