### Project: TAManager

TAManager is a desktop address book application made for professors to manage their teaching assistants (TA) under their charge. It provides fast access to TAs' contact details and their availabilities for tutorials/labs. You can track teaching and claimable hours among your TAs and find relief TAs for impromptu events or unforeseen circumstances.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the command to update teaching hours to all TAs in the current list.
    * What it does: Allows the user to update the teaching hours to all TAs in the current list.
    * Justification: A professor will be managing multiple TAs and requires a command to update in batches.
    * Highlights: This feature requires me to fetch the current list from the given model and update every TA in the current list only if all updates are valid.

* **New Feature**: Added edit free time command for a specified TA.
    * What it does: Allows the user to update the free time interval for a specific day for a specified user.
    * Justification: TAs may have different free time for each day, so users can update for specified days only.
    * Highlights: I reused the editPersonDescriptor in the Edit Command class and modify it to fit the edit free time command.
