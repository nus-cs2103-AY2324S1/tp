### Project EzContact

EzContact is a desktop app made for insurance agents to manage customer details,
optimized for usage via Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EzContact can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
AddressBook Level 3


Given below are my contributions to the project.

###### **New Feature**: Appointment, Add Appointment, Delete Appointment, Mark Appointment, Unmark Appointment

* What it does: Allows the user to assign appointment details: Date, Time, Venue, to a customer, and keep track of the number of
appointments completed with a customers.
* Justification: This feature significantly enhances the product's suitability for the target user.
Users can keep track of appointments with customers to gauge the stage in the selling process that a customer is in to maximise
efficiency and increase their conversion rate of closing customer deals.
* Highlights: 
  * Analysed design alternatives, from the implementation of `Appointment` and `AppointmentCount`
  classes, to handling addition/deletion of `Appointment`, marking/unmarking of `AppointmentCount`
  * Designed the details of what an appointment should contain and its restrictions(Date, Time, Venue) using the
  `LocalDateTime` class vs `String` representations
  * Also detailed the UI appearance output of `Appointment`.
  * The decisions made were mainly driven by ensuring the best user experience
  of an insurance salesman needing the essential tools to keep track of appointments.
