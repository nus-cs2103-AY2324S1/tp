### Project: TutorMate

TutorMate helps private tuition teachers manage their students more easily. Faster access and store of students’ contacts and data, provides better time management and productivity. The app will help to manage students for a single tuition teacher only. The app will only provide simple student analytics (without detailed student progress analysis).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: List command to toggle between different lists (Pull request [#56](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/56))
  * What it does: Allows the user to toggle between the different lists corresponding to different states.
  * Justification: Each state has their corresponding pair of lists, hence this feature allows the user to switch between them easily.
  * Highlights: This also builds upon another feature which allows for conditional display of student details in the student list.
* **New Feature**: State system for app model (Pull request [#68](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/68))
  * What it does: Changes the app to work in 3 different states, where the `STUDENTS` state handles students information, `SCHEDULE` state handles lesson and scheduling, `TASKS` state handles tasks related purposes.
  * Justification: Our app purpose allowed for student detail management, tutor lesson handling and tasks management. Consequently, each purpose had different UI and command behaviour. Hence, we needed a way to separate each purpose.
  * Highlights: This feature heavily impacts the workflow for the user, since it implies the app having 3 different states or "modes" with differing purposes.
* **New Feature**: Student remarks (Pull request [#83](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/83))
  * What it does: Allows tracking of remarks for each student.
  * Justification: There are certain small information for each student that tutors want to remember, that does not belong to a specific category, such as remembering a weak area for a student.
  * Highlights: Remarks allow for flexibility in storing any type of information in text form, giving rise to many applications depending on the tutor's creativity.
* **New Feature**: Command history tracking (Pull request [#169](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/169))
  * What it does: Stores a history of the commands typed during the session, to reuse previously typed commands.
  * Justification: Repeated commands or similar commands have to be retyped or deliberately copy-pasted, which is tedious and has poor usability. Hence, this feature allows the user to quickly retrieve the previous commands entered to re-execute or make minor changes to the command for another execution.
  * Highlights: Increased efficiency in executing similar (long) commands, by simply pressing the arrow keys to retrieve previous commands and making minor changes, rather than copy-pasting or re-typing the entire command.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=pzl111&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme to fit Figma sketch (Pull request [#56](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/56))
  * UI re-design to accommodate a 2-panel layout (Pull request [#68](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/68))
  * Modified the implementation of `find` command, such that it searches using a search string, rather than space-separated keywords which is not intuitive. Also extended find command to work with both students and lessons. (Pull request [#108](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/108), [#132](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/132))
  * Created an alternative theme for the app with larger scaling, used during product demo to aid readability. (Pull request [#134](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/134), [#154](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/154))

* **Contributions to User Guide**:
  * List feature update (Pull request [#183](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/183))

* **Contributions to Developer Guide**:
  * List feature update (Pull request [#100](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/100))
  * State and remark in ModelClassDiagram (Pull request [#100](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/pull/100))

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
  * tP Team Organization Setup
  * tP Team Repo Setup
  * Sketched alternative UI design to use for app

* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
  * 25 PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments)
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams

* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
  * to be added soon
