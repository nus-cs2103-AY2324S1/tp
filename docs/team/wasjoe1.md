### Project: WedLog

WedLog is a desktop application created for partners getting married that helps them manage the guests and vendors involved in the wedding. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. This project is based on [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features
1. **New Feature**: Added the ability to parse inputs for all parameters in guest and vendor commands.
    * What it does: Parses the user inputs and returns command to be executed.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because guest and vendor command inputs can be parsed and commands can be executed accordingly.
    * Highlights: The implementation was challenging because each command had a respective parser class which accepted different types of inputs respectively. This required careful consideration of possible user inputs.

2. **New Feature**: Added the ability to display lists of guests and vendors.
    * What it does: allows the user to view all guests and vendors in a list format.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to have an overarching view of all their guests that will be attending the wedding and the vendors they have in contact.

3. **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter guests and vendors.
    * What it does: allows the user to filter guest and vendor lists by all non-tag parameters.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now filter the guest and vendor list by more parameters, giving them a more customised filter feature.
    * Highlights: The implementation was challenging because each parameter had a respective predicate class which accepted different types of inputs respectively. This required careful consideration of possible user inputs.
    * Also employed defensive programming practices in implementation and applied test heuristics in test case design (observed in Predicate classes e.g. `NamePredicate` and `NamePredicateTest`).

4. **New Feature**: Modified the guest class to take in Dietary requirement field (initial implementation).
    * What it does: allows the user to add a dietary requirement to guests.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now keep track of dietary requirements for guests.
