### Project: CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS

### Overview

CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS is a one-stop application for CCA Heads to manage CCA members and events, optimised for CCA Heads who prefer to use command line interface.
My team and I adapted the product from an existing Java application called [Address Book (Level 3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) over a span of 1.5 months.

Given below is a summary of my contributions to the project. All of my code contributions can be found in this [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wr1159&breakdown=true#/).

### Features Implemented:
* **Command History** [#175](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/175)
  * **Feature details:** Allows users to quickly navigate through commands previously entered through arrow keys.
  * **Justification:** Gives the user the ability to edit their previous command quickly without retyping the whole command in cases where a attriubte is inputted wrongly or where there is a need to repeat the same command for multiple members / events.
  * **Credits:** Implementation is inspired by [Tutor's Pet](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp) 
* **Create `Event`, `Location`, `EventDate`, `UniqueEventList` classes** [#99](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/99):
  * **Feature details:** The fundamental class to encapsulate the event class.
  * **Justification:** Establishes the core structure to track events and it's attributes: `location` and `eventDate`, supporting all event-related commands like `createEvent`, `deleteEvent` and more.

Relevant tests were added for above features.

### Enhancements to existing features:
* **Capitalise Name in `createMember`** [#121](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/150)
  * **Feature details:** Capitalises name input in any case automatically .
  * **Justification:** Users will no longer make a mistake of creating the same member with names of different capitalisation e.g. John Doe and john doe.
* **Delete Event/Member deletes relevant enrolment** [#191](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/pull/191)
  * **Feature details:** `deleteEvent` and `deleteMember` will also delete associated `Enrolment` objects.
  * **Justification:** Enrolments were still stored meaning when a new event/member of the same name is created, they will have the previous enrolments associated.

### Project management:
* Edit GitHub Actions workflow to remove duplicate smoke test on pull requests.
* Add GitHub pull request template to speed up pull request documentation.
* Released Releases [v1.2](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases/tag/1.2) and [v1.3 trial](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3-trial)
