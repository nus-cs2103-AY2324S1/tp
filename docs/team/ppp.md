### Project: TAManager

TAManager is a desktop address book application made for professors to manage their teaching assistants (TA) under their charge. It provides fast access to TAs' contact details and their availabilities for tutorials/labs. You can track teaching and claimable hours among your TAs and find relief TAs for impromptu events or unforeseen circumstances.
