## Project: DoConnek Pro

### Overview

DoConnek Pro offers General Practitioner Clinic Management Staff an efficient desktop application for organizing patient and specialist contact details. Designed to cater to Command Line Interface (CLI) enthusiasts while also featuring an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI), it enables swift execution of routine tasks.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Code Contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=vansh284&breakdown=true)
- **New Feature**: Added functionality allowing users to recall recent commands executed.
  - What it does: allows the user to cycle through the history of commands they executed using the up and down arrows.
  - Justification: this feature improves user experience greatly since it eliminates the need for users to retype commands that they recently executed. Users often need to execute same or similar commands multiple times some of which may be significantly long to type out, so the application should provide a convenient way for them to repeat these commands.
  - Highlights: This feature required quite a bit of analysis of design alternatives. The initial design choice for this feature was overwritten by a later pull request as a neater implementation was found.
  - Credits: Idea inspired by the unix terminal 'up arrow' and 'down arrow' which provides similar functionality.
- **New Feature**: Added  a theme command that allows users to change the application theme.
  - What it does: allows the user to type in a command that changes the theme of the application.
  - Justification: this features enhances the application by allowing users to personalise the application to their color preferences. This improves the overall experience for users of the application.
  - Highlights: This feature required designing of two distinct GUI color schemes that would be visually appealing to users.

    - Adapted AddressBook Level 3 to this application by separating parsing of patient and specialist commands and separating handling of patients and specialists in the address book.
