### Project: LinkTree

LinkTree is the top contact solution for software professionals.
Using our unique tag-based system, access contacts by roles and responsibilities instantly.
With LinkTree, swiftly connect with the right stakeholder,
ensuring smooth project execution and superior collaboration.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  - Implemented "tree" command which will show all the contact information as well as team
information in a tree structure in GUI.
  - Implemented "editTeamLeader" command which allows the user to change the team leader of
an existing team.
  - Implemented "editTeamName" Command which allows the user to change the team name of
an existing team.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Tang-Moyan&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
  - Defined the overall data structure and basic classes to be used for which to be modified
by other teammates later on.
  - Helping others with their questions and bugs.
  - Tested our application throughout as well as managed to find bugs in different components and fixed them. (example [1](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/232))

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  - Extended the "edit" feature such that the identity code of a person will not change
after editing by the user.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Updated the user guide for "edit" related features and "tree" command.
(Pull requests [\#110](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/110), [\#126](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/126))
        * Participated in the production of our User Guide draft in Google Doc and offered various
suggestions.

    * Developer Guide:
        * Updated the UMl diagrams for our modifications in the Logic component.
          ([\#117](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/117))
    
    * Demo Video:
        * Fully responsible for the production of the demo video and update it if there are
some changes to our application.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed with non-trivial review comments.
    * Contributed to forum discussions. (examples [1](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/241), [2](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/392), [3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/218))
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class during the Practical Exam Dry Run.
    * Offered general suggestions to teammates on their implementations of features.
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other classmates.
For example, I first implemented storing developers in a team using his hashcode which they changed to use
an Identity code as an alternative. (examples [1](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/63), [2](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/pull/67))

* **Tools**:
  * Used PlantUML tool to design our diagrams in the developer guide.
  * Used SceneBuilder to edit fxml files and make changes to our GUI.
