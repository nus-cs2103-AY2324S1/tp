### Overview

**ConText** is a desktop app that allows for managing contacts quickly via text commands, with useful features relevant to NUS SoC students.
While it has a Graphical User Interface, most of its user interactions happen via an in-app Command Line Interface.

### Code contributed

[TP RepoSense Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=cloud7050&breakdown=true)

### Enhancements implemented

- Notes feature with flexible validation, integrated with `add`, `edit`, UI, tests.
- Automatic sorting, integrated with `find`, `filter`.
- Designed & helped implement `TestData`, `Messages`.
- Helped with planning & doing wide-sweeping refactoring, including simplifications, code quality, test case improvements. Scrapped various overkill parts of AB3, e.g. `Version`. Helped clean dead/irrelevant files from AB3 (e.g. images, tutorials).
- Helped update many test cases to match our product. Improved existing tests (e.g. `@TempDir` instead of sandbox). Wrote new tests.
- Updated/enhanced/fixed various Javadocs.

### Contributions to the UG

- Wrote sections: Intro, quick start, command format, command details, sorting/saving, limitations.
- Merged AB3 UG back into draft UG. Full pass over UG to add/update/enhance contents.
- Proofread & fixed/filed issues after pages finished building, i.e. after PR reviews.

### Contributions to the DG

<!-- may do a full pass over DG -->
<!-- use cases -->
<!-- appendix: instructions for manual testing -->
<!-- appendix: effort -->
<!-- appendix: planned enhancements -->

- Wrote sections: Sorting, acknowledgements, product scope, NFRs.
- Helped update to match our product.
- Scrapped separate out-of-scope pages.

### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Set up: GitHub org, repo with labels/branch protections/user stories board, Jekyll, Codecov.
- Repo-wide refactor to match our product.
- Managed gradle configs, updated wrapper (e.g. dependencies, fix deprecation, simplification, `clean`). Relaxed checkstyle over time. Kept misc files like gitignore up to date.
- Defined most tasks in [issue tracker](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3ACloud7050), kept it updated & tidy. Managed milestones, labelled/tracked/edited/assigned tasks. Very active in [issue comments](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/dashboards/contents/tp-comments.html#16-joel-leow-cloud7050-60-comments) (e.g. adding details/meeting notes).
- Helped perform milestone wrapups, releases. Performed week-specific tasks (e.g. triaging PE-D bugs, collating progress into MS Teams message).
- Tracked meeting agendas, tasks pending assignment/discussion. Made forum posts for clarifications. Tracked deliverables, ensured done before deadlines. Helped keep meetings moving, e.g. screenshare with annotations to facilitate discussions.
- Worked on docs sections not specific to anybody's features (e.g. [UG](#contributions-to-the-ug), [DG](#contributions-to-the-dg), README, `Ui.png`, `index.md`).
- Made PR template. Added reviewer assignment GitHub bot.

### Review/mentoring contributions

- Reviewed good portion of [team PRs](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/pulls?q=is%3Apr), [quite thoroughly](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/dashboards/contents/tp-comments.html#16-joel-leow-cloud7050-60-comments) (spotlight: [#71](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/pull/71#issuecomment-1768352563)). Reviewed already merged PRs, opened various followup issues for things missed (e.g. [#53](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/issues/53), [#80](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/issues/80), [#122](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/issues/122)).
- Helped clarify/answer questions in GitHub/Telegram/Zoom discussions. Discussed steps for accomplishing certain tasks (e.g. git), ways to enhance certain aspects (e.g. regex).
- Pointed out notable things, e.g. [git details configured different from grading scripts](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-W14-3/tp/commits/master?after=7575f07d444894d96d1849ee81bbb0bdfcd05802+454&branch=master&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster#:~:text=Remove%20rubbish-,DESKTOP%2DITF4GUD%5C94866,-committed%20on%20Oct), team repo watchers, [quiz part 1 automation](https://github.com/Cloud7050/js-canvastransfer).

### Contributions beyond the project team

- Put good effort into [finding HouR bugs during PE-D](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+c%5D). Checked on transferred issues in case I could help clarify.
