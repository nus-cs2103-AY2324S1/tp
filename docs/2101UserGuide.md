## Introduction
As a Co-curricular Activity (CCA) head, do you find yourself struggling to manage your CCA members’ attendances and record the array of events that your CCA has?
Are the heaps of spreadsheets you are using to manage them making you feel overwhelmed? Well, fear not, **CCACommander Ultra Promax Xtra 9000PLUS** is here to save the day!

CCACommander is a desktop application that helps CCA leaders record details of their members and events, whilst tracking every member’s attendance. 
It helps to organise members and events into easy-to-view compartments under a singular [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-gui) while providing granular control to you via its in-built [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/command-line-interface-CLI). 
If you can type quickly, CCACommander can help you complete your administrative tasks much more efficiently than traditional GUI applications.

## Command History
You can quickly recall previously entered commands for convenience as CCACommander stores almost all (see the info card below to see what commands are stored) commands entered by the user. 

Upon selecting the command box, you can use the <kbd>↑</kbd> to <kbd>↓</kbd> key to navigate through the commands entered.

Example:
1. You have just marked attendance for the first member in the member list using the `editEnrolment m/1 e/1 r/Present` command.
2. You can then use <kbd>↑</kbd> to get `editEnrolment m/1 e/1 r/Present`
3. You can edit the member index to get `editEnrolment m/2 e/1 r/Present` to mark the second member as present.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: CCACommander will not store 2 of the same commands if they were entered twice in a row. Likewise, commands containing exclusively of blank spaces will not be stored as well.

Upon entering the <kbd>⌫ Backspace</kbd> or the <kbd>↵ Enter</kbd> key, users will have to re-navigate from the most recent command as it will be treated as an edit or entry of command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `createMember n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `createMember n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  E.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  E.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any given order.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Some parameters of certain commands have constraints on the acceptable inputs. <br>
  You can refer to the [List of Acceptable Values](#list-of-acceptable-values) section below for more details.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Member Commands
The vitality of a CCA lies in its members. CCACommander allows you to manage your members with the commands below:

#### Create a Member: `createMember`
When you first start CCACommander and want to populate CCACommander with your members, you can do it with just one simple command - `createMember`!

Here's how you can use it:<br>
`createMember n/MEMBER_NAME g/GENDER [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

Here is an example command where we create a member **named** "Lim Jun Jie" with **gender** "Male", **phone number** of "83498018", **email** of "limjunjie@gmail.com", home **address** of "19 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119278" and a "publicity" **tag**:

`createMember n/Lim Jun Jie g/Male p/83498018 e/limjunjie@gmail.com a/19 Kent Ridge Crescent, Singapore 119278 t/publicity`

<figure>

    <figcaption>Fig 4: After executing the <code>createMember</code> command</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr class="command-separator">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Edit a Member: `editMember`
If you accidentally make a typo while creating your member, do not worry! You can quickly fix it with the `editMember` command.

Here's how you can use it:<br>
`editMember MEMBER_INDEX [n/MEMBER_NAME] [g/GENDER] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Remember to provide at least one field to be edited!
</div>

Here is an example command where we edit the member at **index** 1, changing their **phone number** to "91234567" and **email** to "johndoe@example.com":

`editMember 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`

<hr class="command-separator">

#### Delete a Member: `deleteMember`

If a member leaves your CCA, get over the disappointment by swiftly removing them from CCACommander using the `deleteMember` command!

Here's how you can use it:<br>
 `deleteMember MEMBER_INDEX`

Here is an example command where we delete the member at **index** 1:

`deleteMember 1`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: The `MEMBER_INDEX` parameter refers to the index number shown in the **currently displayed** member list.
</div>

<hr class="feature-class-separator">

> [Back to top](#top)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Event Commands

As a CCA head, keeping track of event details is a major responsibility. CCACommander allows you to do so with the event-related commands below:

#### Create an Event: `createEvent`

Creating a new event is no longer a hassle as it can be done with just one simple command - `createEvent`!

Here's how you can use it:<br>
`createEvent n/EVENT_NAME l/LOCATION d/DATE [t/TAG]...`

Here is an example command where we create an event **named** "Party" held at the **location** "Raffles Hall" on the
**date** 2023-09-16, with **tag** "Dinner" and **tag** "Sem1":

`createEvent n/Party l/Raffles Hall d/2023-09-16 t/Dinner t/Sem1`

<figure>
    <img src="images/CreateEventPostCommand.png"
         alt="createEvent Post Command">
    <figcaption>Fig 5: After executing the <code>createEvent</code> command</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr class="command-separator">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Edit an Event: `editEvent`

If you forget to note any important details, or realise that you made a mistake in any field of the event created,
the `editEvent` command is here to help!

Here's how you can use it:<br>
`editEvent EVENT_INDEX [n/EVENT_NAME] [l/LOCATION] [d/DATE] [t/TAG]...`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Remember to provide at least one field to be edited!
</div>

Here is an example command where we edit an event at **index** 1, changing the **location** to be "MBS" and the **date** to be "2023-10-20":

`editEvent 1 l/MBS d/2023-10-20`

<hr class="command-separator">

#### Delete an Event: `deleteEvent`

Are your events piling up? To clear the clutter, you can delete any unwanted event from CCACommander with `deleteEvent`!

Here's how you can use it:<br>
`deleteEvent EVENT_INDEX`

Here is an example command where we delete the event at **index** 1:

`deleteEvent 1`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: The `EVENT_INDEX` parameter refers to the index number shown in the **currently displayed** event list.
</div>

<hr class="feature-class-separator">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Enrolment Commands

Enrolments are a way for you to manage your members’ involvements in your events. The enrolment commands below are the bread-and-butter for your participation tracking needs:

#### Enrol a Member to an Event: `enrol`

Now that you have added all your members and all your events, keeping track of your members’ attendance to any event is as simple as using the `enrol` command!

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`enrol m/MEMBER_INDEX e/EVENT_INDEX [h/NUMBER_OF_HOURS] [r/REMARK]`

Here is an example command where we enrol the member at **member index** 1 to the event at **event index** 1, where our member
has contributed 2 **hours**, and we want to leave a "Role: Photographer" **remark** to reflect their role as a photographer:

`enrol m/1 e/1 h/2 r/Role: Photographer`

<hr class="command-separator">

#### Edit an Enrolment: `editEnrolment`
Accidentally mixed up two members and gave them the wrong number of hours or wrong remarks for the event they are involved in?
You can fix this with ease by using the `editEnrolment` command!

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`editEnrolment m/MEMBER_INDEX e/EVENT_INDEX [h/NUMBER_OF_HOURS] [r/REMARK]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: Remember to provide at least one field to be edited!
</div>

Here is an example command where we edit the enrolment of the member at **member index** 1 to the event at **event index** 2,
changing the number of **hours** to 5 and the **remark** to "Role: Exco" to reflect the member’s role as an exco member:

`editEnrolment m/1 e/2 h/5 r/Role: Exco`

<hr class="command-separator">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
#### Unenrol a Member from an Event: `unenrol`
If your member is no longer involved in a particular event, you can easily remove them from the event by using the `unenrol` command!

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`unenrol m/MEMBER_INDEX e/EVENT_INDEX`

Here is an example command where we unenrol the member at **member index** 1 from the event at **event index** 1:

`unenrol m/1 e/1`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: The `MEMBER_INDEX`/`EVENT_INDEX` parameter refers to the index number shown in the **currently displayed** member/event list.
</div>

<hr class="feature-class-separator">

> [Back to top](#top)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View Commands
In CCACommander, you can quickly change the view to fit your current use case, be it to check for the enrolment of an event, 
searching for a member and more!

#### View Events of Member: `viewMember`

If you want to view the events in which a particular member is enrolled to, you can do so via the `viewMember` command.

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`viewMember MEMBER_INDEX`

Here is an example command where we want to view the events in which the **member** at index 3 in our member list is enrolled to:

`viewMember 3`

<figure>
    <img src="images/viewMemberPreCommand.png"
         alt="viewMember Pre Command">

         alt="viewMember Post Command">
    <figcaption>Fig 7: After executing the <code>viewMember</code> command</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr class="command-separator">

#### View Members of Event: `viewEvent`

If you want to view the members which a particular event has, you can do so via the `viewEvent` command.

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`viewEvent EVENT_INDEX`

Here is an example command where we want to view the members that the **event** at index 1 of our event list has:

`viewEvent 1`

<figure>
    <img src="images/viewEventPreCommand.png"
         alt="viewEvent Pre Command">

         alt="viewEvent Post Command">
    <figcaption>Fig 9: After executing the <code>viewEvent</code> command</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr class="command-separator">

#### Find Member in member list: `findMember`

If your CCA contains many members and you don’t want to scroll past tens or hundreds of members, you can use the 
`findMember` command to instantly filter a list of members with a matching name.

Do you want to find multiple members? Fear not as you can simply add more names one after another.

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`findMember MEMBER_NAME [MORE_NAMES]...`

Here is an example command where we find all members with the names of "Anthony" and "Nicholas":

`findMember anthony nicholas`

<hr class="command-separator">

#### Find Event in event list: `findEvent`

Similar to `findMember`, `findEvent` allows you to instantly find your event among your multiple events.

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`findEvent EVENT_NAME [MORE_NAMES]...`

Here is an example command where we find all events with the event name of "Party":

`findEvent party`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
The find commands require the names to be typed in full, meaning "Nich" will not suffice for finding "Nicholas". 
The names do not have to be capitalised too! 
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb:
The find commands are powerful tools to help you work faster. Want to view the attendance of Nicholas, but you don’t 
want to scroll the member list? Use the `findMember` then follow it with the `viewMember` command to achieve that. 
This is applicable for both members and events!
</div>

<hr class="command-separator">

#### List all Members and all Events: `list`
If you’re in the event/member view, you can always use the `list` command to return to the default view with all members and events.

Here’s how you use it: `list`

<hr class="feature-class-separator">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Utility Commands

the wrong event or enrolling the wrong member. Simply enter the `undo` command to undo your previous command, 
and it will return to the previous state.

Is it time for a new academic year when you need to remove all your previous members and events for new members and 
events? You can use the `clear` command to instantly remove all your members and events without needing to delete them one by one.

Here’s how you can use it:<br>
`clear`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Accidentally cleared your list? 
Fret not as you can use the `undo` command to recover your data! 

</div>
