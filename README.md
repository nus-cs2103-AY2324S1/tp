* This is **a project forked from CS2103T TP Software Engineering (SE) for SE students**.<br>
  </br>
  * This application allows students to track their applications to companies
  </br></br>
  * It also allows students to take note of application deadlines
  </br></br>
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written**
  code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules,
  without being overwhelmingly big.
  </br></br>
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  </br></br>
  * It is named `LinkMeIn` as it was inspired from LinkedIn's functionality. However, this
  project puts a spin on LinkedIn by allowing students to track their applications to companies.
  </br></br>
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the
[SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
</br></br>
* If you would like to contribute code to this project,
see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
