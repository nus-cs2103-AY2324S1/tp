* This is ProjectPRO for university students with a lot of projects.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Group contact lists 
  * Track group mates availability
* The project simulates an ongoing school software project for a desktop application (called _ProjectPRO_) used for managing group mates
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
