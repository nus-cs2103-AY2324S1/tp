Jobby is a desktop application that helps you manage your job applications by easily recording organization and recruiter contacts, plus note down information about your applications. It is optimized for CLI use, so you can operate the application with only your keyboard.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing contact details regarding organizations and recruiters and job application status info.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * It is an extension built on top of **[Address Book Level 3 by se-education.org](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* For detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Jobby Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w08-3.github.io/tp/)**.
