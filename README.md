**Connexion** is a desktop application for undergraduate students to manage their networking connections.
* It is optimized for text UI usage via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
* Users can view their connections on a neat Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you:
1. are a **fast** typer
2. prefer a **lightweight** user interface instead of fancy graphics
<br>

**Connexion** will get your connections sorted out in no time.
