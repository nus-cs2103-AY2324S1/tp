## Spend N Split (SNS)

Spend N Split (SNS) is a desktop app for managing expense from contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SNS can get your contact expense management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Main features:
* Manage contacts and their personal information
* Manage expenses between you and your contacts
