# MediSync

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

**MediSync is a desktop app specifically used for head nurses to manage staff and patients.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).<br>
  
Instead of tracking data of staff and patients using existing applications such as Microsoft Excel, using a CLI-centric application like MediSync will help head nurses track and handle contact management more quickly.<br>

## Download
To start using MediSync, head to our [release page](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103-T16-2/tp/releases) and download the latest version!
