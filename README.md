[![CI Status](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-0/tp/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F08-0/tp/actions)

> Introducing the NUSearch: Your Comprehensive NUS Contact Tracking Resource

## Description
NUSearch is designed for NUS students seeking quick access to contact details of professors, teaching assistants,
or fellow students enrolled in specific modules or tutorials. It allows NUS students to store all the relevant information
of their peers, teaching assistants and professors in one place through a systematic and user-friendly approach.

## Motivation
We aim to simplify the process of accessing academic information by developing an efficient directory app.
This app will help students to consolidate professors, teaching assistance (TAs) and their classmatesâ€™ profile,
improving the ease of accessing the details of individuals whom the students might need to contact for that semester.
