This is a CS2103T project by [AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-1](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w10-1.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html). It is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/).

TAfinder is a desktop app for NUS professors to find and track Teaching Assistant (TA) information. It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are an NUS professor that can type fast, and who is in need of an app to find and manage TA information, TAfinder is the app for you!
