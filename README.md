* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _HouR_) used for managing employee records.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 12 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `HouR` because it was created with the aim of helping HR personnels handle their data efficiently.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HouR Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w12-1.github.io/tp/)**.

**Acknowledgement**
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
