TutorMate is a desktop app targeted to tuition teachers for managing contacts of tuition students.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TutorMate can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This project is based on the [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://se-education.org).
