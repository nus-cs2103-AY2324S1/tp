## Overview
Pawfection is an animal catalog catered towards volunteers in an animal shelter. With Pawfection, we aim to reduce the
pain points of volunteering at an animal shelter by providing a centralized platform for volunteers to store and retrieve
information about sheltered animals easily!

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * Ideal for the fast-typist as it is command-line centric.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * Comes with detailed documentation for both **users** and **developers**. To learn more, check out [Pawfection's website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-f08-3.github.io/tp/index.html)!
