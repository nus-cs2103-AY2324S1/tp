## FumbleLog
![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png) 

FumbleLog is a **productivity desktop application** built to for **NUS Computing students** to help you manage contacts and track events.
It is designed to be an easy-to-use, one-stop platform for all your scheduling needs.

* If you are interested in using FumbleLog, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](docs/UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing FumbleLog, the [**Developer Guide**](docs/DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.

The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _FumbleLog_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FumbleLog Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
