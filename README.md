JobFindr is a **Desktop-based Job Application Management App** for **NUS Fresh Graduates** to record, track and organise
their job applications.

JobFindr aims to simplify your job application management by targeting the following benefits:

1. _Flexibility_ in **adding**, **deleting** and **editing** job applications and interviews
2. _Efficiency_ in **finding** the specific application with minimal keywords
3. _Organisation_ in **sorting** the list of applications to not miss out on key opportunities

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _JobFindr_) used for managing job
  applications.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 10 KLoC)
      than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see
  the [JobFindr Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/tp/).
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
