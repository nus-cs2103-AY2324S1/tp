**CodeContact is a desktop application for managing your employee details in a software company.** While it has a GUI,
most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).<br>

Example usages:

* An HR of a software company can easily access the contact information of all employees so that he/she can quickly
  communicate with them regarding HR-related matters.
* The project manager can use it to maintain a list of project collaborators and their contact information so that
  he/she can quickly assemble teams for new projects.
* A basic developer in a software company can view the positions and roles of everyone in the contact list so that
  he/she knows who to look for when needing some help.

The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing
contact details.

* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than
  what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `CodeContact` (`CC` for short).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the *
  *[Code Contact Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
