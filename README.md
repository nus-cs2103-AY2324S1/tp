TASsistant is a CS2103T project by AY2324S1-CS2103T-F12-3.
This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

TASsistant is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) in NUS to track information about the students and professors
involved in tutoring. It is optimised for users that have experience with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and aims to be
able to handle contact organisation faster than GUI apps if the user can type quickly.
