* This CLI application is designed for **Engineering Managers of tech companies.**

    Example usages:
  * Schedule an interview with an interviewee
  * Detect clashes in interview timings
  * Write notes about the interviewee
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[InterviewHub Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t11-2.github.io/tp/)**.

* This project is an ongoing software project for a desktop application to make the hiring process easier
  * It preserves the **OOP principles** of the original project
  * It **evolves** the base project into an app with a narrower target audience
  * Our team is working on this project, so we can **practice the SE tools** that we have learnt in class.
* It is named InterviewHub since our app aims to centralize the interview process within companies.
  * By placing all the critical utilities involved in one app, it increases the quality of life of our target audience.

**Acknowledgements**
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
