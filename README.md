- This is **a desktop application for managing contacts, that is optimised for Command Line Interface(CLI) usage with the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI), InsuraHub aims to improve the productivity of financial advisors who prefers typing.**.<br>
  Example usages:
  - Keep track of daily tasks(to be added soon)
  - Manage clients efficiently(in progress)
- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named `InsuraHub` because it allows financial advisors a way to manage their large client base and appointments.
- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[InsuraHub Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103-w14-1.github.io/tp)**.
