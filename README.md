* This is **NetworkBook, developed for team project for CS2103T AY2324-S1**.
* The project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 software project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org), which is a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of the original project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.

## Project direction
