## What is TimetaBRO?

TimetaBRO is a desktop application targetted at NUS students
for storing and keeping track of your peers' schedules.

Created by NUS students, for NUS students,
TimetaBRO aims to help you easily compare others' schedules with your own
and efficiently find common free times with your friends or project group mates.

With TimetaBRO, forget hopping around screenshots of timetables to compare them,
or wasting time going back and forth with your friends trying to find a meetup time!
Instead, store all your friend's timetables on one platform and save yourself from all the hassle.
Schedule tracking and coordination has never been easier, faster, or more convenient!
