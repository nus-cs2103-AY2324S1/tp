- This is **NetworkBook, developed for the team project component of CS2103T AY2324-S1**.
- The project is based on the [_AddressBook-Level3_](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3) software project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
- Networking is crucial to the career development of computing students and computing professionals. However, it can be hard to keep track of the many people we network with in university.
- NetworkBook aims to be an **easy-to-use** tool which helps current and future computing professionals from NUS **manage contact information of their network**.

## Project direction

1. **Product name:** NetworkBook
2. **Target user profile:** Computing Professionals from NUS/studying in NUS who are looking to network with each other.
3. **Value proposition:** As computing students and professionals network with alumni to expand their career prospects, our app keeps a list of contacts of people that each user networks with.

- Users can sort contacts by priority, courses taken/taking, specialisation(s) taken/intending to take.
- This project is offline, and has a static online page that contains user manual and download webLink.
