**NUSCoursemates** is a desktop app for managing contacts and their courses, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUSCourseMates can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
