* This is a **Teaching Assistant(TA) Management app for National University of Singapore(NUS) School of Computing(SOC) professors**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Access TA's contact details and availability for relief classes
  * Track TA's renumeration details
  
* It is named `TAManager` (`TAM` for short) because it was intended for easy management of TAs.
* For detailed information about this project, including a user guide and a developer guide, visit our **[product page](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t10-1.github.io/tp/)**
* The project builds on a brownfield software project called _AddressBook_ used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * For detailed documentation of _AddressBook_, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
