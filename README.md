# TutorMate

[![CI Status](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/actions)

TutorMate is a desktop app targeted to private tuition teachers on handling tuition related matters.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, TutorMate can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This project is based on the [AddressBook-Level3 project](https://se-education.org).

## Main Features
1. Student Management System: track all student details
2. Lesson Schedule: easily plan and manage lessons
3. Task Lists: keep track of tasks to be done for lessons
