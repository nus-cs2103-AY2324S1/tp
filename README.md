* Link Tree.<br>
  Example usages:
  * LinkTree is the top contact solution for software professionals. Using our unique tag-based system, access contacts by roles and responsibilities instantly. With LinkTree, swiftly connect with the right stakeholder, ensuring smooth project execution and superior collaboration.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called LinkTree) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
