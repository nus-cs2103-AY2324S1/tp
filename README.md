* This is our **team project** for the course **CS2103T** in AY2023/2024 Semester 1.
* This project is based on the `AddressBook-Level3` project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* We named it `Class Manager 2023` (`CM2023` for short).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Class Manager 2023 Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t11-1.github.io/tp/)**.
