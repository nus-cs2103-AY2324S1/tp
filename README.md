# WellNUS

WellNUS is a contact management application for NUS Student Counsellors.
WellNUS helps counsellors better schedule their appointments with students, as well as store the information of students for easy referencing.

Example usages:
  * adding, deleting and viewing student profiles
  * tag students with risk levels depending on their condition
  * adding, deleting and viewing appointments
  * adding, deleting and viewing todos or follow-up actions

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
