## Overview

**CampusConnect** is an address book specifically catered for students living on NUS campus.
With CampusConnect, you can stay organised, stay connected, and make your on-campus experience at NUS stress-free!

**CampusConnect** is:
* written in Java, in OOP fashion.
* a desktop application that uses command-line interface (CLI) with fast, easy-to-use commands which make it ideal for the
  fast typist.
* documented for both users and developers. For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[CampusConnect Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* optimised for CLI.
* a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.

## Features
1. Keep track of various details of fellow campus residents
2. Receive reminders for fellow campus residents' birthdays
3. Mark specific contacts as emergency contacts
4. Search for fellow campus residents using expressive filters
