# FAPro

## FApro seeks to improve the quality of life of financial advisors (FAs). It allows FAs to **keep track of large numbers of contacts**. It allows FAs to have a one-stop platform to **manage their contacts** and **conduct financial analytics** while providing a big-picture view of their clientele as a whole.

## Problem Addressed
* A lot of contacts
* Hard to track which clients have existing products and which products
* Possibly volatile contacts as need to keep up with them over long periods of time
* Share info on a large-scale basis
* Do analytics
* Provides them with an overview of all possible clients (big-picture)


* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[FAPro Product Website](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
